Lots happened this past weed. I'll cover the key points here.  
_Wednesday  
_I took a half day on wed so we could get ready. Went to bed early in preparation for...  



_Thursday_ We left about 4:30am and drove to PA to get Terrasha. It was a pretty uneventful drive and we arrived about noon. Another 8 hours to RI then to bed.  



_Friday_ We had quite a bit to do on friday to get ready for the wedding. Mostly, we put together favors and such. I upgraded my parent's computer to XP as well. My dad's friends from England (Dave and Rebecca) came over for dinner. We had Saugies and beans and such. There was some chatting and watching of baseball.  



_Saturday_ Kennedy's for breakfast (mmmmm!) and more setup. I helped my dad fixup the outdoor chapel at the church. We had to even some of the ground and clean up some apples. We also put the arbor up. Jenn had her shower and James hung out at my parent's place. A beer and some chatting occured then it was time to get the girls for the rehearsal. We were only about 5 minutes late and the rehearsal went very smoothly. My aunt and grandmother hosted the rehearsal dinner which was excellant. Lasagna, eggplant torte, salad, wine, crackers, blueberry pie, and other yummies greeted my palette, After dinner we met some of the Rochester crew and headed out to Providence for Waterfire. We watched the fire dancers for a while then headed over to one of the brew pubs. More chatting then it was time for a water taxi ride we had signed up for. Meg and James headed out to their hotel to get some sleep and the rest of us piled into the boat for a wonderful water tour of Waterfire. When that was finished we stopped at Haven Brothers for a hot dog then to Woonsocket to drop everyone off.  



We dropped Sara and Katie at the Woonsocket motor inn. I dropped them at the covered unloading area and some truck pulled up wanting to get through. He was blocking my path so after a minute of this I just backed up. He went speeding through and almost hit me so I honked at him. He stopped and got out of his pickup truck and started walking towards us in all his redneck glory. I could have run his dumb ass over if I had wanted....the first rule of road rage....never leave your big metal box! After pointing out that he cut me off he started towards us again. Although plenty capable of discharging a drunken redneck I decided it was best to have nothing more to do with this guy so I started backing up to go around him. He shouts "I thought so..." then got back in his truck. It appeared as if he was following us to Jenn and Terasha's hotel but he may simply have been kicked out of his house and was looking for a place to pass out. Terasha's was getting all angsty and kept pointing out that she was gonna kick his ass. I had to lock the doors to prevent her from leaving. He circled by us a couple of times then sped off down the road.  



_Sunday_ I was the first one up in the morning at about 7. I took a shower then woke up Graham and my Parents. My dad made some pancakes and we had a bit of breakfast. We all headed down to the church to set up chairs. Next, my mom headed out to her hair appointment and dad and I went to get the cake in Braintree. After getting the cake we met my mom at Chan's to drop everything off. Down to the church again to set up the last of the chairs (some were being used during services so we had to set the up now) and look at the flowers. Back to the house again to get ready.  



Graham and I went down to the church at about 2:30 and there were a few people waiting. Graham started seating them and I chatted a bit. The musicians were a little late and started about 2:45. That was ok because Jenn, Terrasha, and Jenn's parents were also 15 minutes late. The photographer never showed up and we are not sure what happened but we got lots of good pictures anyway. The ceremony went well. Perfect weather...a few tears...and a great poem from my grandfather. Saw everyone at the receiving line then off to Chan's.  



The cheese and crackers disappeared fast and the musicians were wonderful. Dinner was fabulous and we received lots of praise for out selection. Graham wrote a wonderful poem in liew of a toast and Jenn got some cake on her nose. *grin*Â  Nik (the DJ) was super funny and even my mom (who kept saying we should have had more live music instead of a DJ) liked him. There was an American Pie before the Rochester crew left and the party wound down early but we got to talk to lots of people and there was some dancing. A few of us were around at the end and that's where the party really got going. Jenn's brother was break dancing and even Nik joined in the festivities.  



There were too many cute babies there who were all vieing for the title of Cutest. I'm not sure who won in the end. Some random wierd guy on the street helped the bride's family decorate my car (with cans and all that) which Jenn and I sped off in to the Providence Biltmore.  



Our suite was nice with a great view of Kennedy Plaza.

_Monday_ In the morning we went back to my parents for brunch. Jenn's dad came over as well and we opened out gifts. We got some great stuff and some wonderful cards. The car was loaded to the brim and we got on the road about 1:30 in the afternoon. We dropped Terasha off about 9:30 and continued on for a bit. Jenn got tired so I took over but that only lasted about an hour. I tried a 30 minute power nap but only drove a bit further before I decided we needed to sleep. We slept 3 or 4 hours in the car at a rest stop in western PA then got moving again. A brief stop for gas and a snack and Jenn took over again. She drove into OH but was getting sleepy again and the fog was getting really thick. I drove the last two and a half hours and we rolled into Fairborn just before 9:30. Jenn missed her first day of work. We tried calling them early in the morning before she was supposed to go in but we couldn't reach anyone. We got a hold of them at about 10 and Jenn's boss was very understanding. Jenn was told to get some rest and start tomorrow morning instead.  



I'm at work now finishing a few things up. I'm probably leaving early (about 3:00). I'll have put in a half day which is fine. It balances the half day I took last wednesday which was originally going to be a full day off.  



I'll post some pictures when I get more ready. There was some video shot and I plan I getting it transfered to DVD. I'll fill the rest of the DVD with pictures. When it is done I'll let everyone know. You can request I copy and I'll send you one. (or I may put it online depending on the final size).
