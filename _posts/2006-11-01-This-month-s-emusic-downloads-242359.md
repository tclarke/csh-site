Last year's album from VNV. Nothing surprising here. Good vocals over EBM synth. I particularly like the synth line at the beginning of Interceptor.  
Yet another Cleopatra tribute album. It's quite good especiallyÂ  Thousand (covered by RIB). Not typical RIB...more melodic. Anyway, here's the list from this one.



  * God Moving Over the Face of the Waters - Transmutator
  * Machete - interface (another good track)
  * Bodyrock - Decoding Jesus
  * South Side - Tre' Lux
  * Porcelain - Glampire
  * All This I Need is to Be Loved - Joolz
  * Go - DL Matthew Grim
  * What Love - Dragon Style
  * Thousand - Razed in Black
  * The Sky is Broken - Aleister Einstein
  * Hymn - Haujobb
  * Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad? - Issa



One of my favorite Rosetta Stone albums. Got stolen so I'm replacing it.  
Tre' Lux is Tina Root's new project. Much less serious sounding than Switchblade Symphony with a trip hop sound. This is an all cover album with some interesting interpretations, especially Black Hole Sun and Yellow. Here's a list of the songs for your enjoyment.



  * Never Let Me Down Again
  * Come Away With Me
  * Wild Horses
  * Yellow
  * The Chauffeur
  * I Know There's Something Going On
  * What's On Your mind (Pure Energy)
  * Black Hole Sun
  * Karma Police
  * Every Day Is Halloween (the perfect song to listen to the day after halloween)
  * Run
  * Bad Trash (a slightly bouncier cover...show's Tina's transistion from SS..got a nice guitar bit during the chorus)
