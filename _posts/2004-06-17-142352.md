Went to Mighty Taco and Niagara Falls last night. I hadn't been to the American side in a long time and Jenn had never been. It reminded me on the thing I like most about large waterfalls...you walk downstream towards the falls and the rapids are deafening....crashing around you. Then you get to the falls...160000 gals/second of raw power, only a couple of feet from you....and it's nearly silent. You can hear the rapids behind you and the water hitting the rocks below, but it's very far off like in a dream. I'm always taken aback by this.  



This morning things finally hit me. The full force of "I am moving away from Rochester, probably for good." My mine quickly bounced around to the faces off all my friends and I thought about how much I'll miss everyone.



Time for breakfast...Jim's awaits.
