Well, it's been more than a week and my computer is still broken.  
I'm typing on my qnx box which is annoying because the qansi terminal  
type is not entirely compatible with vt100 so vi and other full screen  
visual editors are a little braindead (lines disappear, etc.) Harumph.



I have a test in distributed AI today. I should probably study for it.  
Now that klutzywaitress is done using her computer, I can jump  
on and download the notes.
