Why do I put myself in stupid situations. I always think, "one day this will bite me in the ass." Apparently that day has come. Definately learned my lesson. I'd like to say I'll apply that lesson and stop doing stupid things but I'm afraid I won't.  



Oddly enought, the part of all this that is upsetting me the most is the anxiety about telling someone what is happening.
