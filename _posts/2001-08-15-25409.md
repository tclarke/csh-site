I saw [Final Fantasy: The Spirits Withing](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0173840) tonight. The plot was a bit one dimentional and the end was kind of cheesy and difficult to follow but it was ok. The animation was fabulous. Facial features were highly detailed. Clothing moved independantly of the body. Jane even had nipples. :) Anyway....well worth the $1.50 at Movies 10. If you havn't seen it, catch it for $0.50 before 6:00.
