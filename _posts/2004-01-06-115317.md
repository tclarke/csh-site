My uncle (only known him a few years, my aunt's second hunspand) has been in and out of the hospital the last couple of weeks with something they couldn't identify. His biopsy came back and they think it's pulminary fibrosis. Since then it's progressed quickly and he's now on a respirator. They are giving him huge doses of some cancer medication trying to stem it for a while to try and find a lung transplant which is pretty much his only hope at this point. It's wierd because I barely know him. He and my aunt didn't get together until I was in Rochester but I still feel bad, mostly for her. Well, all I can do for now is hope for the best I guess.
