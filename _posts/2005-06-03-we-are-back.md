After another long drive, we are back in Dayton. The drive wasn't too bad, only a little traffic south of Cleveland and it only lasted about 10 or 15 minutes. Thanks again to Robin, Kim, and Abigail for putting us up (and putting up with us).Â  The cat was quite excited to see us when we returned and is now outside warning the stoop. I'll put a summary of our vacation below a cut.  



Friday mostly involved driving. We left a little after noon and arrived about 10. After locating kim, we decided to get a snack and walked to the corner for some Highland Park Diner snackage. Sleep was had by all.  



The next morning, we got up earlyish and went to the public market for breakfast and a little shopping. Got some honey, a flower, and some yummy apricots. Back to the apartment to get ready for the wedding. The ceremony was nice, although a bit long. We then had nearly 6 hours to kill before the reception. We stopped for lunch at Bruegers and talked to Jeff and Eileen for a while. There was a nap and some chatting back at Robin and Kim's place and we communed with Abigail for a bit. Off to the reception which was picnic style. I had a burger, and some sides. Met some new people, danced with jenn, then we ducked out a bit early. That night we went to Vertex. Jenn and I met Mimi and her roomey Sarah. We also convinced (it actually didn't take much convincing) october31st to join us. This caused a few problems as she could not locate us at first. After a series of keystone cops/benny hill chase scenes she arrived. A good time was had by all. After club, food at Mykonos. Mmmmm.  



Sunday morning involved crepes at Simply Crepes. Some hanging about occured. I've just blanked on the remainder of the day (need more coffee). Also, I need to go to a meeting so I'll end this post here. Watch for updates in future posts.
