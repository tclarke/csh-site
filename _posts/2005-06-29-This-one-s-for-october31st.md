An article about academic papers and gibberish mentions the arbitrary shuffling of jargon and how it often fools reviewers. A footnote is attached.  



"A disconcerting example hit me last night, listening to an audio CD of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice with my player inadvertently left in shuffle mode. Fortunately, I know the plot well enough to notice that Elizabeth and Darcy seemed to have shacked up naughtily in Pemberley before he had successfully proposed."
