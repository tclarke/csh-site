Just downloaded my emusic for the month. Here's what I got.  



Johnny Cash...what more is there to say. This was my last song for the month so I only got Folsom Prison Blues for now.  
This is some classic rock song covers.



  * Black Betty - Young Fresh Fellows - This is a pretty good cover, true to the original.
  * Hocus Pocus - Spies Who Surf - F'ing A! A surf rock band covering Hocus Pocus! \m/
  * Mississippi Queen - God's Acres - Pretty hard...has a live feel to it. Not too bad



Grabbed this good VA album of goa/psy since I can't listen to internet radio at work. I used to listen to a lot of goa at school and I've been missing it. Here's the song list.



  * The Penguin (LP Edit) - Donut Junkie
  * Aftershock - System 4
  * Normal Talkover - Double Secret
  * Denja - Bioreactor
  * The Argon Clones (remix) - Van Battle
  * Herpes Simplex - Latex Empire
  * Nervous Track - Atomic Bits
  * Incognito - Aerial Servant
  * Tempest - Luminary
  * Phaselift - Aegis



This is performed by Michael Grebanier. I love Rachmaninov...so sensual.  
Includes:



  * Sonata in G minor for cello and piano, Op 19: all 4 movements
  * Romance in F major, Op 4 No 3: Lento
  * Lied in F minor: Andantino

  * Sonata No 16 in B flat, K 570: Allegro, Adagio, and Allegretto
  * Sonata No 14 in C minor, K 457: Molto allegro, Adagio, and Allegro assai



Performed by Christian Hommel. I havn't gotten any new oboe recordings in a long time and I figured I'm overdue. Besides, Chistian Hommel is an incredible oboeist.



  * Allegro
  * Largo
  * Presto
  * Allegro
  * Adagio (Alessandro Marcello)
  * Presto/li> 



In other news, I'm drinking some yummy abbey ale right now, a dubbel. I just bought an external hard drive enclosure. USB2.0 and Firewire; up to 300gb drive; 30W power supply; includes power cable, usb cable, and firewire cable. $31 with free shipping! Rock the fsck(8) on! I'm gonna put an old 80gb drive in there and put my music on it. I can shuttle it back and forth to work and I don't need to keep burning CDs with my newly downloaded music on them!  



Oh, and this song has one of the meatiest grooves I've heard in a long time...I have a feeling I'll be listening to it a lot.
