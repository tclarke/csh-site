Come to [A World A'Fair](http://www.aworldafair.org/) in Dayton this weekend. Lots of food and entertainment from tons of ethnic groups. It's friday, saturday, and sunday. $5 gets you in. Food and gift prices vary from group to group. My kung fu school will be giving an interactive demo on sunday at 2:00. Come check it out.
