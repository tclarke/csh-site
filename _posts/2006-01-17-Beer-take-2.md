Ok, at least two people expressed interest in making beer but are busy this weekend. When would be a good time? The weekend after? Mid-week sometime? Also, what type of beer would you like to make (or do you not care) I'm thinking of making some abbey ale this weekend then making some more of something else another time. People can pitch in for ingredients and take home some beer when it's done.
