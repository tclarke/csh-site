I just walked out of my Computer Vision class; 35 minutes in and still no professor. I got my homework assignment time stamped so he'd know I was there on time. Better not lose credit, I was up till 1am working on that one and the printouts cost me $6.75. Got another project due tomorrow. Too many assignments not enough time.  



In other news. I'm now the primary web cosultant for Fox Creative (I get first dibs at their web app coding jobs). Got one coming up soon (the guy working on it is dropping the ball but they want him to try and finish the phase he's working on). Should help the cash flow a little bit (I like making $50-$80 per hour again). Still gotta work at Brueggers because I don't know how often I'll get work at Fox.  



Time to choose classes for next quarter now. Not sure what I'm gonna take....any suggestions?
