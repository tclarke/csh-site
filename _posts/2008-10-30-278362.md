Jenn bought us tickets to a get out the vote concert tonight....Beastie Boys, Sheryl Crow, and Ben Harper! It's gonna rock....  



I did realize how old I'm getting. I'm sitting at my desk thinking, "The doors don't open until 7:00 so I've got plenty of time to take a nap before the concert." Ugh..

<p>If it makes you feel any better, we are going to a gaming event next weekend and we are trying to make our plans so that we have nap time before the event!</p>
