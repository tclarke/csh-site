[Jenn](http://www.livejournal.com/users/klutzywaitress) and I are finally in RI. Slept through the alarm at 6:00 and didn't leave till almost 1:00. Got stopped in traffic (that's right, cars were not moving at all for like 20 minutes) bnecause of an accident. Ate leftovers at home (mmmm, chicken yummy things) athen I suprised Jenn with some ice skating at the fleet ice rink in beutiful downtown Providence. Went to Haven Brothers for hot dogs after. Haven Brothers is one of the only mobile diners around (this is for you kim). It's been going to the same corner every night since 1888. It's a little trailer you go inside and sit down for food. MMMMMM!!! Ok, bed now.
