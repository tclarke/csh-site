First kung fu class of the quarter...went well. Went to the Sarah Slean concert at RIT. It was pretty good. She is quite the ham...very animated. She reminds me of an anime character: skinny and petite, red hair, cute red dress worn over black stretchy pants, small mouth and face normally, outrageously huge mouth when open.  



That is all, I have to work now.
