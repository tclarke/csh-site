I woke up at 4am today to catch a 6:45 to Denver. It was worth it tho since I arrived about 8am local time. Plenty of time to drive to the mountains and ski for the day. It was a great day...the place I went had 3 lifts open and enough runs to make it worthwhile. It was sunny and clear all day until about 2:30 when the wind picked up. I toughed it out until closing then drove the 4 miles up a crazy steep and unprotected switchback to Loveland Pass which is part of the continental divide. The wind was furious up there and it was so cold I couldn't stand more than about 5 minutes outside the car. Drove back to Denver and checked into the hotel. It's on the main street in downtown so I walked around a bit and had a quick bite to eat. I'm getting ready for an early night since the conference starts up early tomorrow morning.
