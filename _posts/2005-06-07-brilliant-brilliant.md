Ok, buy me a Guiness cause I just stuck it to the man. This is friends-only in the highly unlikely event that it makes it back to those involved. Ask for the details if you like...let's just say that there was an issue with my new packet8 ATA that stopped it from working. The issue is fuzzy and I felt there was a chance that they would blaim me for it and not replace it. In order to prevent such alligations (as they would be difficult to defend on my part) I informed them that it had just stopped working shortly after getting it. Upon further investigation, I found one of the pins in the ethernet port had broken off, apparently from a manufacturing defect.  



The tech support guy said he'd never heard of this happening. I offhandedly told him I'm an IT type person and have occasionally seen this problem. Apparently the jacks must get fed incorrectly into the machine that bends the pins over and they get stamped such that they break off. He agreed this sounded plausible and started filling out the RMA info. Now, here's where it gets interesting. The issue is actually firmware related and as such, is a sticky matter. They may try and blame me for the issues simply because it'd possible to cause firmware problems and ney-impossible for me to show that it arrived this way. The hardware issue I actually reported is easy to verify. When I snap off the lead to show this, they will be unable to plug it in and access the web-based configuration/status info on the ATA and see that there is a problem with the firmware. Game, set, match.  



BTW, I have no qualms doing this even tho they may have been able to re-flash the firmware and fix the problem then re-ship the ATA. It turns out the ATA is a re-branded leaktek device. Packet8 owns a good portion of leadtek. They most likely get them dirt-cheap. I'll probably pay more for shipping than it costs them to replace the hardware.
