My flight out of Dayton was delayed on Friday due to weather. We arrived two and a half hours late so our ride was not there. We too a pay shuttle to the hotel and finally got into our rooms about 12:30 in the morning.  



Saturday we woke up and registered for the tournament. Most of Saturday was spent watching classmates compete in tai chi and lei tai. Helen tied for fourth in tai chi weapons and our one full contact fighter came in fourth in his division. It was a long day but we got to see lots of interesting tai chi and wu shu.  



Sunday was the big day for most of us since most of the traditional kung fu divisions were on Sunday. Mike and Cherish were upset that they did not place in any of their divisions but they did well with their two person weapon set. The problem was that there is only one division instead of intermediate and advanced divisions so they were competing with some very advanced people. They scored in the middle of the group which was quite good for their experience level. I didn't do so great in my open hand form; bad stances and I was too fast so some of it was a little sloppy. I did quite well with my weapon form earning a third place. We hung out and watched the rest of the tournament, had some dinner, and watched a movie later. (The latest Die Hard...it was ok)  



Monday morning our flight was delayed again because of weather. It was stuck in Boston this time instead of Baltimore. We arrived about an hour or so late.
