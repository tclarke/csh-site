Ok, so I don't post much anymore and every time I do post, I promise to be more frequent. However, my day to day life is pretty routine and boring (as tends to happen when one settles down a bit). I therefore leave it to you, my readers (if there are any left still) to decide the future of my posts. Is there something in particular you'd like to read about? Should I pontificate and philosophize? Should I write up tutorials on whatever topic happens to be interesting me at the time? Should I post the most mundane details about day to day goings on such as what I ate for each meal and what I plan to watch on tv? Maybe I should continue to do nothing and only make a post when something truly exiting happens? The only thing I won't do is post every single silly meme that shows up on the net...I occasionally do them when I'm particularly bored but in general I have better things to do at work than tell you for the nth time what school I went to and how I felt when I found out Luke and Leia were contemplating an incestuous relationship.

<p>I read, but if it's not interesting I stop.  Pontificate if you like.  </p>
