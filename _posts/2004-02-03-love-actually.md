Jenn and I saw Love Actually last night. It wasn't exactly what I expected. It did have a gushy happy ending but if you get rid of the last 15 minutes or so, it was about the agony of love. The plot was complex and interlocking (think Magnolia, Pulp Fiction, etc.) and the stories where interesting. The acting was quite good but I expected as much from the cast. This movie was most definatly worth the $1.50 I paid to watch it. In fact, I'd consider buying the DVD.

<p>What did you think of the kid?  Wasn't the kid awesome?   He's actually a cousin of Hugh Grant's.</p>

<p>I thought the entire cast was quite good. He was very good, especially considering his age. He really got a lot of complex emotions across which is tough for any actor.</p>
