In case anyone cares, I placed 10 out of about 35 at the Galyan's speed climbing comp. There's a 30 second clip of my climb [here](http://www.csh.rit.edu/~retrev/galyan_climb.avi). The last move is missing but it wasn't too exiting. Lost my groove about 2 moves after the overhang. Oh well, not bad for not climbing all summer.
