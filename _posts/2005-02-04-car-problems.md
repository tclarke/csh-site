So last night I'm driving how and there's a clunk sound. Less than 1/4 mile to go I figure I'll look at it when I get home. Another clunk and something goes flying out from under the car.....I collect the object hoping it was just something in the road I hit....it's a piece of one of my leaf springs. That's right...I somehow snapped a leaf spring. Oh, and there's also something hanging from the muffler...the rust shield I think. (if so...that won't be too bad).  



This morning I call the dealer for an appointment. Monday is the earliest. After talking with him I bit he says he may be able to look at it today so that he can at least order the part so it'll get in a day early. I can't go for a week without my car so I had to rent something....about $200 for the week for a cavalier (with jenn as a second driver). The car is in the shop right now and I'm awaiting a phone call. I'm also getting some recall work done on the fuel pump (on of the contacts is prone to corroding in high-salt areas) while the car is there.  



On a lighter note...we are having a soup-a-bowl party at work. Ppl bring in soups and we eat them. Hopefully they will not suck. I would have brought something as I have a couple of homemade soups in the fridge right now (italian wedding and spicey celery if you are curious) but I don't have enough to bring for a work party. Oh well.
