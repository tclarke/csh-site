Some remixes and extended versions, a couple of b-sides. Overall, not bad but nothing special.  
The latest from Mike Skinner. I was a bit disappointed with this album. It's typical of his style: hard synths, minimalist bass line and in your face lyrics. This album is missing that working class "fuck it all" attitude. Instead of continuing to sing about how hard live is for the average joe, he's tackling his celebrity with this album. It just doesn't ring the same chord...reminds me of the Simpson's episode where Homer joins Lalapalooza.



> **Homer:** I'll miss you, Pumpkins, but I just can't share your bleak world view. I've got too much to live for.  
> **Corgan:** We envy you, Homer. All we have is our music, our legions of fans, our million of dollars and our youth. [pause] Woo-Hoo!  
> **Iha:** Let's all go out and buy fur coats!  
> **Chamberlin:** I want a walk-in humidor.

Latest from Dieselboy. Got all of disc 1 and most of disc 2. I havn't listened to the entire thing yet but I'm liking what I hear. Typical of his other d&amp;b; albums; lots of fast loops and thumping bass. It's hard not to get up and dance to this one, even if you aren't into d&amp;b.; I think this will be first in my mix on monday morning at work. There's a great mix of Wargames on here.
