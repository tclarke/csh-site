I was going through some junk email today, removing myself from mailing lists. I go to the remove web site for some porn list and it struck me as humorous. Imaging: someone who is disgusted by porn and the very thought of it (religious freaks, etc.) gets this email because their credit card company sells their address. They go to remove themself and this appears.
