Originally, Jenn made plans to go to a halloween party in Columbus. We hadn't heard anything is a while and didn't know if it was still happening so we planned on going to the SOB dig in Cincy instead. Later, Jenn didn't feel like being social so she was going to help out at the restaurant for the night. Anyway, the original party host emailed Jenn and the party was still on and.....*drum roll*......she had two tickets for us to go see Jon Stewart! So, off to OSU we went. The Daily Show is broadcasting from OSU all week for their pre-election coverage and they had a show for OSU students and guests on Saturday. It was a "moderated forum." Basically, they answered some pre-submitted questions (and a few shouted out questions), showed some clips, and were generally amusing. The panel consisted of Jon Stewart, Samantha Bee, Jason Jones, the head writer, and the executive producer. It was fun...we were about 6 rows back in the center so we had a great view.  



Afterwards, we went to the party. It was interesting...had a couple of beers and chatted with some people. Jenn and I left pretty late (probably close to 3 but that was with the time change)...had to stop for a half hour and take a nap so I wouldn't fall asleep on the way back to Dayton. All in all...a pretty good night.
