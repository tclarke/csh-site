I may be in Crotchfester another year woking on my MS. The only problem, what should I do for my masters thesis. I have lots of ideas but they are either too big or they are projects I'd like to do elsewhere. Anyone have suggestions for a computer science master's thesis? Soft constraints: AI, game theory, cryptography, number theory, distributed and parrallel computing.
