It's been a while since an update...I just havn't felt like posting. First off, Jenn is awesome...she got us tickets to the Cincinnati screening of [Serenity](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379786/). Also, it's been a fairly social weekend, met lots of new people.  



Tonight I have to go to traffic court for the ticket I got a couple of weeks ago. I have not gotten my new license yet as I was out of town, then broke, then missed the open hours at the testing bureau on sat, and it's not open today. I'll bring this up the the judge and hopefully not look bad.  



We got our plane tickets to RI. One way as we are driving back up with my mom and probably some other family members. Not sure who yet. They will be up for a few days at the beginning of next month. Trying to figure out what to do while they are here. I think Cincinnati and Yellow Springs will be definate trips for my mom. Not sure what else. Any suggestions?
