I was driving to RIT today and saw quite a sight on the corner of Pioneer and Scottsville. There was a car stuck in the side of a house. That's right...I didn't have a camera so here's a rough sketch.

As you can see...the car was 3-6 feet in the air at about a 30 degree angle stuck between the house and a tree. It broke through part of the first floor and part of the foundation. When we got there, 2 cops and a fireman were staring at it probably trying to figure out how to extract it from the house.  



On Scottsville I got to drive behind a mint condition blue 1959 MGA coupe. (the coupe are not very common) Since I have a 1959 white MGA roadster I was elated to see this fine automobile.  



Also, I got a job today. It seems like it'll be an ok part time job while I'm in grad school. I'm working at Bruegger's in Southtown plaza baking two days a week and working the counter the rest of the time.
