Ok, I've been sick all weekend....nothing terrible, just an annoying cold but it has been making me kinda miserable. I'm drugged up right now so it's not too bad but I expect to be whiney by this evening....it will probably mean missing kung fu again (didn't go satuday because of sickness coupled with a late night) and I hate doing that, but sometimes life need to go on hold for a little while.  



I'm dealing with a really annoying problem at work....I can see no reason why this person is having the problem he is and it's been using up most of me time since wednesday. Hopefully I'll fix the problem today.  



Lot of interesting things in the new today. The woman who had the face transplant has done an [interview and there are some pictures](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4685202.stm). Also, there has been an interesting development in the hunt for dark matter. It seems that [dark matter is much warmer than expected](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4679220.stm). Looks like [BMW is being blacklisted by google](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4685750.stm).  



Finally, I havn't said anything about the whole Muslim anger about the political cartoons mostly because I havn't distilled my thoughts into something coherent. [Satyrblade pretty much captured it tho](http://satyrblade.livejournal.com/137335.html).  



That's all for now....
