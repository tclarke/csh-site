The other day I put some water on the stove to boil and I went to my computer. Of course, I forgot about the pot with the water. Running downstairs I thought to myself, "Hmm, I don't remember cooking bacon. Maybe Brian is making some breakfast. Oops, we don't have any bacon."  



I run into the kitchen and the bottom of the 18/10 stainless steel pot is glowing bright red. I remove it from the stove and it sticks a little (there are now marks on the pan from the heating element). The salt I put in the water and whatever mineral salts were already in it are crusted to the bottom and there is a faint smell of burnt plastic or enamel.  



I cool the pot cover in some water and it turns a nice copper color. Tarnish remover shines it nicely but does not remove it. I slowly cool the pot in some water and notice the inside looks like it is rusted....somehow I rusted stainless steel.  



I scrubbed vigorously with a copper scrub pad and some baking soda to little avail. There is a blackish grey granular coating on the inside of the pan...I can just make out the normal inside. Not sure if I can recover this one.
