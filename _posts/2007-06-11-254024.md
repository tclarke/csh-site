It was a pretty dull weekend but it was busy. Worked at the Yellow Springs Street Fair on saturday, then went to Gisel's party for a little bit, then off to another catering at night. Crashed hard when I got home and slept in until after noon. I had planned on working in the garden a little bit on sunday but we were running misc errands for much of the day. Jenn went to a clothing swap party and I read for a bit. Finished the book I was reading last night...last in the series but I want more. I made some beer last night. I was planning on a Scottish heather ale but I think it will end up being a wee heavy since the starting gravity is 1.070.
