I just put some new (and old) pics up. There are some pics from an old dig (the Companion Ball), a few from the Forth of July, and some from our trip to the Cincinatti zoo. [Check them out](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96369621@N00/).

<p>Just give us a little notice so we can get a little time off to do something. Cincinatti and Columbus are an hour away, Indianapolis is just over two hours, and Toledo is about three. All four cities have fabulous zoos (for the Abby :) ). Lots of outdoorsie stuff to do and a town (Yellow Springs) that you guys would love...very hippy-dippy.</p>
