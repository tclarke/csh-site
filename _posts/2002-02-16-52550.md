My SE project is coming along nicely and my group members are not completely useless. (Just kidding guyes :) )  



My DAI project is nearing an acceptable state but I'm still not happy with it. I have to document it some more and then try and make it not suck.  



I'm going home to sleep now 'cause I'm sick of working.
