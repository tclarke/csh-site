Just got back from the Vertex halloween party. It was great. TONS of people were there (even with the more open dance floor, there was no room to dance at times).  



My OS2 project is about done. I just have to review our final docs. Eric saved the day by fixing our last problem early so I could go out tonight. Wh00t!  



I entered the Gallyans climbing comp today. My best prelim time (it's speed climbing) was 35.2. I don't thing that's good enough for a spot in the finals but it's not bad for someone who hasn't had money to climb all summer.  



I'm going to sleep now. G'night all.
