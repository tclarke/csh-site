My boss has finally crossed the line. I intend to quit my job before I go on a killing spree or something. I'd leave today but I need to secure another job first so I don't get evicted, etc. I believe everyone on earth has a perfect match....a soul mate some might call them. Well, they also have a perfect adversary and I believe I have found mine.
