<p>ooohhh. heard those are quite nice. although, I also heard that the animal really isn't worth the extra $100. i'd be interested to know what you think of it and if you think getting the animal model was worth it. i'm sure it beats the pos we have.</p>

<p>to be honest, I wasn't sure about the extra $100 either, but it comes w/ extra attachments, some spot remover, and other stuff besides the 'tough on pet hair (or Trevor Hair, fine by me ;) )' construction.</p>
