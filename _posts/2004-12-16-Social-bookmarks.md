I've been playing around with social bookmarking at del.icio.us lately. Basically, you publish "bookmarks" on their site under your account name and others can retrieve them. A nice way to publish interesting links w/o having to email or msg a bunch of ppl or make a whole LJ post just to put a link up. (easier to organize them as well). If anybody is interested in watching mine, you can go to <http://del.icio.us/retrev> to get my list....or if you have an RSS aggregator, you can get RSS from [http://del.icio.us/rss/retrev.](http://del.icio.us/rss/retrev) If you have Firefox 1.0, it has RSS aggregation built into the bookmark system and this is a great way to keep an eye on these.



  1. Open the bookmark manager
  2. Select File-&gt;New Live Bookmark
  3. Add the http://del.icio.us/rss/retrev link



That link looks like a bookmark folder containing all my links.  



You can go there and create your own account as well. If you do, let me know what your account name is.
