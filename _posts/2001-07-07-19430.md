My mom and grandmother were up for the weekend.....they leave tomorrow morning. It's been a fairly uneventful weekend. Went shopping, etc...ended up at Vertex with [](http://www.livejournal.com/users/fuzzybunny/) and [](http://www.livejournal.com/users/gemineyemimi/) last night. There were not many ppl there tho, I think darkwave's band was playing again so many were probably there.
