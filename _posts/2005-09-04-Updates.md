Friday was quite a day. The night before, a power transformer in the office park where I work blew. It fried our internet router so no internet and not connection to the Boulder office all day. The A/C was out all morning too. It was quite a headache because we couldn't fill out our timecards (they are electronic and hosted in Colorado) and it was the end of the month so they had to be filled out so we can bill the government. They managed to set up a timecard connection on one machine in the SCIF that had another connection to the base's network. In other work news, I've been porting our app to Linux/Itanium2 and I get to play with an SGI Prism. 8 Itanium2 processors, 20Gb ram, and 4 ATI FireGL video cards...that's right, 2gb video memory, can drive 8 displaysÂ  for a resolution of up to 16384x12288.  



This evening, Jenn and I volunteered to sit at the Greene County Democrats booth at a local small town festival. Not much happened as is typical in a sleepy little town.  



Tonight, Venus and Jupiter are both right on Virgo so it's quite an interesting sky to watch. Probably too late now to see much but watch early tomorrow night in the western sky and you'll catch it again.
