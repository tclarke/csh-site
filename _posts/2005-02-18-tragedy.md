Yesterday I was wearing my favorite socks (100% cashmere, gray, and oh some comfy...a gift from [my sweety](http://www.livejournal.com/users/klutzywaitress)). They started slipping down and bunching in my shoe so I gave one a tug to pull it back up and I ripped it....across the back just above the heel.... :(
