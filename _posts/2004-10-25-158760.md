I watched [this](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356721/) on friday. It was most excellant and is recomended for all. Did some cleaning and watched games 1 and 2. Dinner on saturday consisted of yummy home made pizza and [Young's double chocolate stout](http://www.youngs.co.uk/).Â  Sunday's dinner was bangers and mash (with bangers from in store at Dorothy Lane Market) and the remainder of the Young's.
