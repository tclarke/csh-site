We made it to Rochester without any problems. Traffic wasn't too bad except for two accident-related jams near Cleveland. We went to the public market this morning and had empanadas. Got some apricots, honey, and a flower for Jenn. Leaving for the wedding soon.  



Later tonight, we'll be going to Vertex so meet us there! Also, if you'd like to get together while we are in town, reply here. Things we are planning at some point: Nick's, Jim's, Jay's (probably after vertex), the Toad (tuesday or wed night). Get your opinions in on times and stuff so we can firm up our plans.
