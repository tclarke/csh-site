It's been far too long since I've updated. I've been doing a lot without really doing anything (I know, how tao is that?) I'm making some progress on my thesis and I'm making a little money with my plethora of jobs.  



This weekend, it's time for a break...that's right, time once again for [Simcon.](http://www.simcon.org) I'm playing in the Dark Ages Vampire LARP (two nights), some munchkin, Paranoia, Big Eyes Small Mouth, and maybe a little Amputheatre for good measure. Update from the con if I get time.
