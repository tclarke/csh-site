Ball announced this quarter's earnings of $90.7mil, 23% higher than last quarter. This is resulting in a 33% increase in the quarterly dividend and a 2-to-1 stock split. The annual average return on Ball stock is 25%. This is the 4th split.  



Throw in a 20% match stock purchase plan (up to $6000 annually) , a 50% 401k match (in stock), and a 401k performance match program. Looks like I may have a nice retirement in store. Oh yea, if I'm here for 5 years or more, I'm eligable for a pension plan..100% company funded.
