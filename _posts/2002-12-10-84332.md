I started bo training in kung fu last saturday. It seems like it will be quite enjoyable. saturdays are now infinately more busy for me. Kung fu, weapons work, and LARP every other week. Hmm.  



Finally got a project assignment in class. Started working on it last night. Pretty easy stuff. Gotta make a train switchyard program using Java.RMI. Gonna get another assignment soon in computer vision. Should be easy too..I think it will involve writing a binary image labeling program. Easy stuff.  



Shogun Total War finally works. It's ok, but I like MTW better I think. I'll give it a chance tho.  



Time to go get [Jenn](http://www.livejournal.com/users/klutzywaitress) from her photo lab.
