**Reply and I'll give you a letter. You have to find five songs that start with that letter and post them to your journal.**   
october31st gave me W.  



1\. The Warling Birds - Hong Ting (the the doesn't count :-P)  
2\. Wrecking Yard - Switchblade Symphony  
3\. Why Is It So Hard - Madonna [Dead or Alive cover]  
4\. Wet My Bed - Iggy and the Stooges  
5\. Weak Become Heros - The Streets  



I picked the next 5 W songs in my party shuffle.
