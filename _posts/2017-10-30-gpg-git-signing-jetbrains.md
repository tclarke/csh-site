Git has a great feature to prevent fraudulent commits, especially in public repositories.
You can signed a commit with a PGP compatible tool (GnuPG is probably the most common).
This is great when you're using the command line tools, just do a `git commit -s` and you're good to go.

If you're like a lareg number of developers, you're using an IDE of some sort for your heavy coding days.
I'm a particular fan of the various Jetbrains IDEs: PyCharm, WebStorm, RubyMine, etc.
There's a pretty full featured git integration available for all of these and while I still use the command line somewhat often, it's nice to be able to hit `âŒ˜k` and commit from the IDE.
There's currently no option to sign a particular commit from the IDE (there's Sign-Off but that just adds a line to the commit message).
However, you can set things up to sign all of your commits, but there are a couple of gotchas.
Here's a quick walkthrough of the process.

* Install GnuPG. Ok, this is more of a pre-requisite, so it's up to you to do this one your own.

* Create a key for signing. There are lots of tutorials on this process, so again, left as an exercise for the reader. Note your key ID, you can get it with:
{% highlight bash %}
> gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
...
ssb   rsa2048/0F40BD647EFF33D6 2017-10-12 [S] [expires: 2021-10-12]
{% endhighlight %}
That `0F40BD647EFF33D6` is your key ID.

* Configure git to allow signing. Use `git --global --add commit.gpgsign true`, etc. to configure the following, with your values substituted.
{% highlight bash %}
> git config --global --list
user.name=Trevor R.H. Clarke
user.email=tclarke@ball.com
user.signingkey=0F40BD647EFF33D6
commit.gpgsign=true
{% endhighlight %}

* Configure GnuPG to use a graphical agent to prompt for passwords. This goes in your `~/.gnupg/pgp.conf` file which probably lives in a slightly different location on Windows.
{% highlight bash %}
no-tty
use-agent
{% endhighlight %}

* Commit a change in your IDE. I always select the Sign-Off option as well. You should be prompted for your GnuPG password. Once you've committed, you can double check that it worked with the command line.
This example shows a commit without a signature and one with a signature.
{% highlight bash %}
> git log --show-signature -1 -2
