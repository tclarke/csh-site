"It is a ceremony never omitted among the vulgar to draw lots, which they term _Valentines_, on the eve before Valentine-day. The names of a select number of one sex are, by an equal number of the other, put into some vessel; and after that, every one draws a name, which...is called their Valentine, and is also look'd upon [as] a good omen of their being man and wife afterwards."  
\-- Henry Bourne's _Antiquitates Vulgares_, 1725  



"Some of those who once drew slips of paper with their Valentine's name in this manner wore them pinned to their sleeves, leading to the phrase ``to wear one's heart on one's sleeve.'' "
