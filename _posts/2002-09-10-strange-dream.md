Last night I dreamt that I was in RI with Jenn and Brian. Brian had set up some sort of door stop system in the old kitchen and got a little mad when we changed it so the doors would open. We went back in the room and Kim and Rachel were sitting on the couch. Rachel came back to get some things she had left. She was being a real jerk. I was trying to catch up a bit while helping to get things together and she was being condescending and mean.  



Later, we were driving up Wilbur by the field and it was full of Norse ghosts riding away from the house. Ther house looked very different; lots of glass doors and windows. There was a big party going on. Woke up around then.
