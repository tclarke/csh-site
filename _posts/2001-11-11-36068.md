I climbed in the Galyans' speed climbing comp yesterday. I came in last for the finals, but 10th overall (out of 35 or so). Not bad considering I havn't climbing all summer. I have an AVI of my climb and I'll post it and an analysis when [Brian](http://www.livejournal.com/users/fishslayer) grabs it off his camera.  



I'm going to build a DVR and I'm looking for some advice on componants. It needs to be inexpensive (but expandable). I have a 3dfx video capture card/tuner and a Pentium box. I'm gonna upgrade to proc as much as possible (P200MMX or P233MMX I think) and add more disk. I'd like another video cap card so I can record 2 channels at once and I need a video out card. Perhaps I can find a good, inexpensive video in/out (full duplex only) card preferably with hardware video compression (MPEG-2 at a bare minimum) for this. Cost needs to be low (definately under $100) and PCI as the machine does not have AGP.  



I'll probably use Linux with modified [Linux-DVR](http://dvr.sourceforge.net/) software (uses v4l and /dev/dsp).  



So, any suggestions? Also, anyone know of any cards that do Digital Cable decoding? I'd like to use my TWDC w/o their set-top box and I'd really like to decode their channel guide.
