You are a Trad Goth, you like your classic Gothic  
Rock bands, and swear that Andrew Eldritch is  
in fact God. You can easily be comfortable with  
being considered a Death Rocker also. You still  
like the basic black clothing/makeup, and don't  
care if it's now considered stereotypical. You  
also still go for the teased hair look. You  
most likely gave up on the club scene long ago  
when they started playing that "oonz  
oonz" shit. Picture of Siouxsie Sioux
