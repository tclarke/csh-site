It's definately been a while since I've posted, but is anyone surprised? I didn't think so. The [annoying crisis](http://www.rge.com) finally ended. I applied for another RIT job, this time as a UNIX admin at the library. I'm on the winter quarter dean's list which is always nice.  



riffraff joined klutzywaitress and I for a great easter dinner of lamb and potatoes and hot cross buns and veggies and coffee and...  



klutzywaitress is completely moved out of her apartment now.  



I am sleepy and thirsty so I'm going to raid the kitchen...probably eat too as kung fu is later.
