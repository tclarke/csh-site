Ok, I've been crazy busy since getting back from vacation (and before that) so it's time for an update.  



We closed on the house finally. Jenn went over today to meet with the contractor and the kitchen is gutted. We're settled on the cabinets so it looks like the kitchen will be done first. We are figuring it will be about 5 or 6 weeks until everything is done but we can probably move in about a month so I need to put in notice with my landlord. We'll be wanting to move probably on labor day weekend and we'll be looking for help. Beer and grillin' food would be provided of course. If you can help out, let me know and I'll add you to my list. Since this is still tentative, I'm not looking for definate commitments right now. Ok, so Peaches has a new album out called Impeach My Bush. It amuses me.  



I'm pretty excited about the new Mac anouncements at the WWDC today and I'm pretty sure I'll be buying a Mac Pro desktop the end of the year sometime.  



We saw Al Gore's movie recently and it was good...you should all do see it. Also saw A Prairie Home Companion which was mega mega super awesome. Finally, SOAP is coming out soon....who wants to get some opening night snake action going on?  



There's a new juice bar in Yellow Springs. They grow their own flats of wheat grass and it's very affordable: $1.50 for a 1oz, $2.50 for a 2oz. Their juices are good also. They also have a small brew supply shop with some good gear and materials. Jenn and I are planning on attending the YS homebrew club next Sunday at 7:00 if anyone else is interested.  



My cousin and his wife had their second child last week...finally (we were hoping she would have the baby while we were down there). It's a little girl named Sophie.  



Work has been pretty good. One of the developers is leaving the end of the month and we are looking for a replacement. Anyone want to do some C++ development with a great group of people? Great work environment, good pay and benefits, some corporate red tape and BS but not too much. Let me know (preferably with a resume) and I'll pass it on. We don't always pay for relocation but if you're a strong candidate they can usually do something.  



Lastly, I'm downloading some emusic. Some FSOL and I'm not sure what else. I'll post a quick review when I'm done listening.  



So, how's everybody else doing?
