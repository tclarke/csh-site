Today's writeup is elph. Not sure if she'll see this but I'll do one anyway. I havn't chatted with Lindsay in quite some time and it's a bit of a shame. She's half of my favorite telecom duo! She's usually quiet, quite private and one of those people who's good moods are contagious. When a smile crept across her face you couldn't help but feel happy and alive. She's another former Duteau Shaolin student which makes her Swell in my book. Now for some questions.



  1. Still doing kung fu (or any other martial art)?
  2. How's work and all that?
  3. How are you enjoying VA?
  4. Got any pets?  



  5. If you could be any fruit or vegetable, what would you be, and why?
