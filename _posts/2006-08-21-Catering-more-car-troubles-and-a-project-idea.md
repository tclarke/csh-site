Well, the catering on saturday went ok...things were a bit unorganized since I wasn't there from the beginning to impose some sort of order on things....everything still went pretty smoothly. There was a bit of an accident on the way....a couple of tray of food slipped off the rails in the hot boxes during the long drive spilling quite a bit of curry sauce in the box. Upon opening said box, a river of curry came flooding out...I've had dreams like that.  



Sunday we moved the new table and chairs to the new house and headed back to return the trailer. I stopped at a red slight which was on a slight hill. I started letting out the clutch then heard a huge bang and the car stopped...I shifted into 2nd and started forward to get out of the way...1st gear is done...you can hear it trying to engage but nothing happens....probably the fork on first is bent. Dropped it at the transmission shop this morning...still looking at it but the guy agrees it's probably the fork. Jenn's dad suggested that when I talked to him and it makes sense to me as the rest of the gears are fine. The shop is still waiting on some quotes for parts and hasn't opened the transmission yet, but assuming it's the fork and making some reasonable estimates on the bearing kit (the part we are waiting to hear about), it will be about $1500. Hopefully it's nothing more serious. I'm a little upset about this obviously, but we've already decided we can't afford to go to Damon's wedding so this makes things a little less tight in the wallet. At least next month has three pay checks, no mortgage payment, and only a partial rent payment.  



In other news, I've been looking at L4 which is a badass microkernel....crazy fast. I'm thinking of building my alarm/home automation controller with L4. I'll probably use an x86 based system; maybe a soakris or gumstix, something with no hard drive and low power requirements so I can run it off a battery backup....a laptop would work but I'd have to use an external peripheral board for the alarm....anyone have some extra hardware (Pentium-era stuff is fine) that I can run fan-less and off battery? I'll need to put some custom I/O on it for door sensor's, etc. and probably CAN-BUS for the temperature units. My other option is to port L4 to m88k and use one of my VME systems...this might be fun regardless so I may do it anyway. Finally, anyone want to work with me on the software? I'm in the design phases now and I'll make a post soon with some technical details....lots of lower-level hardware hacking and embedded OS work as well as some higher-level GUI stuff to make it all pretty.
