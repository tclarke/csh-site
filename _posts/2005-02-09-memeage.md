Some of these could probably use some explaination but I'll leave those out. Feel free to comment if you want clarification. I'm also ignoring rediculous technicalities (like marking the kiss a member of the same sex because I've kissed my father) but some iffy technicalities do get in. (leaving a job with the pens and paper in my desk count as stealing from an employer)
