Jenn is flying to NH tomorrow for her uncle's funeral. I am not going because I have a lot of work to do (we can't afford another plane ticket anyway). I will miss her :(   Gone tomorrow morning at 5:00 and back monday just before midnight. I wish I could go with her but it's just not gonna happen this time.
