I havn't been able to send any email from home for a couple of days and I finally had a chance to track down the problem. It seems that my provider now filters port 25 everywhere but to their smtp server. No email telling me this (even tho I never check that address, I just did now and nothing). Apparently it's because a lot of spam has been coming from their addresses so they are restricting smtp access (vs. roadrunner which blocks (or at least they did when I had a cable modem) smtp, etc. to prevent ppl from running servers on consumer level connections)  



Not that it's a big deal to use their smtp server (it's probably faster this way) but it would have been nice to know without having to wade through their FAQ.
