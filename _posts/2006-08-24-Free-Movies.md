<p>I have rehearsal :/ ... how late are they running?<br>
<br>
I was thinking about hitting Therapy after rehearsal to get one of the bartenders to school me on making the perfect dry martini.</p>

<p>We went to a 9:40 show.<br>
<br>
Dry martini...<br>
 add ice to shaker<br>
 add some french vermouth (about an oz) and shake gently to cover the ice<br>
 pour off the vermouth<br>
 add 1.5oz-2oz of gin<br>
 stir gently for about 10 seconds to chill the gin<br>
 add garnish to the glass (olive for a martini, onion for a gibson)<br>
 strain the gin into the glass and serve</p>

<p>Hmm yeah I doubt I would have made it by then. We didn't get out until 9:30. Hope you enjoyed it! I haven't made it out there.<br>
<br>
Hey thanks for the recipe! Now then ... we need to get together so I can practice ;). I think I'll still go down to the Therapy sometime to get that bartender in the glasses to teach me in person (hey, she's cute. sue me.) :P</p>
