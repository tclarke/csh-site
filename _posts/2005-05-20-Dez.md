Time for dezco62. Dez is comic relief for the world, but in all the good ways and none of the bad ways. His sense of humor is odd but viral. Whenever you need a pick me up, talk to dez and you'll forget all your problems and end up ordering various cheeses and singing wierd al songs. Dez was recently married and I never did congradulate him but it couldn't have happened to a more deserving guy.



  1. Who is your favorite paraody song writer off all time, and why?
  2. In one sentance or less, describe your ideal toe nail clipping.
  3. How's life in Texas? AKA, How does it feel to be a Connecticut Yankee in King George's Court?  



  4. How was your trip to the Caribbean? We havn't seen pictures yet!
  5. For the benefit of my lj-friends who do not know you....make us laugh. I'm sure someone out there could use a little infectious humor.
