Ok, so I just created an identi.ca account. If you don't know, it's a microblogging service similar to Twitter but it's open source, open protocol, and content is creative commons licensed. I don't blog too much so I may not use it a ton. I created it mostly to support the project and play a bit...I'll likely use it at conferences, etc. for updates. Username is retrev if you want to subscribe. If you're using identi.ca, what's your username?
