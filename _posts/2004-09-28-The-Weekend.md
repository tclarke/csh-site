It was quite a weekend.  



Saturday, we went downtown to the seafood store and got some fried clams and tilapia for dinner. Clams were consumed in front of the Dayton Art Institute. We got tickets to their Oktoberfest for this coming weekend and we looked around the Asian art wing. Decided to take a slightly different way home and I'm glad because we found a little farm market....bought some apples and unpasturized cider! (MMMM!!)  



Sunday was a day of cleaning. We vaccumed, did all the laundry and finally picked up the books in the living room. They are still in boxes but those are organized a little better and the living room is set up a little better. (the zen garden and fountain are set up, the goban is out, etc.) Jenn hung up a lot of pictures and stuff. Our neighbors (the ones in the same building as us) are moving a few blocks away. They sold their place to our landlord. We are going to ask how much rent would be over there as the walls are painted a bit nicer color with some stenciling, there are two fireplaces, and there's a hot tub. Since the neighbors still have the place through the end of the week but are already moved out they said we can have free reign of the hot tub so we spent some time relaxing in it sunday. (and monday after kung fu :) ).  



In other news, my RAID card is finally on its way. I got it off ebay but the guy I bought it from had a death in the family so it's been a while since the sale ended. I sent him a reminded email last week and he admitted he forgot about it but would get it out as soon as he found the driver CD. I told him not to bother as I won't be using it under windows so he send it right out. I also mentioned that it was ok as I don't have drives for the card yet anyway. Turns out he has an extra that he doesn't need since it's a SCSI drive he used with this card. (The drive that was the mirror died so he didn't need the RAID card anymore) Anyway, he's throwing in the drive no cost because of the late shipping date. Not bad...a  SCSI (ultra wide) RAID card and a 2.17gb IBM drive (not sure all the details on this) for $0.99 plus $8 shipping.  



My gramps (dad's mom's second husband) came into a little money recently when his sister passed away. He gave half of his inheritance to my grandmother (who's in a nursing home due to a stroke a few years back) and she wants to give a little to my brother and I as she's never really had the money to give us much...just small gifts or cards for birthdays and christmas. Anyway, her bank is going to wire it to my brother's bank account (he's in school and doesn't have a job so he won't have to pay tax on it) and he's gonna write me a check for my half. I think it'll be about £1000 each which is quite nice. I plan on putting mine in a CD or maybe buying some more stock with it. in 6 or 9 months when I have a couple of weeks vacation I think I'll use some of it to pay for a trip to England to visit my grandparents (and the rest of the family). We've been wanting to go for a while and I think this is a good use for some of the money.  



As for work, last week was very productive but I'm having a little trouble getting rolling this week. Maybe I'll do something else for an hour and see if I can get back to my main task.
