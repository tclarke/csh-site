Something I frequently think about and debate has come up again. The US Electoral College. How does everyone feel about the current system? Yea or nay? Why? I'll list some of the common arguments for and against below the cut to get started.  



Against EC (usually pro direct election)



The EC unequally weights votes in different states. I.E. Individual Texas votes are worth less then individual Rhode Island votes since each electoral vote in Texas represents a larger number of people.  



  * The EC does not represent the will of the masses since someone losing the popular vote can win the EC.  



  * The EC causes candidates to concentrate on large swing states and ignore smaller and less contentious states.  



  * The EC (or more so, winner takes all) gives a disadvantage to third parties enforcing a two party system.  



  * Third parties are suppressed by winner takes all EC. It's very difficult for a third party to have much of an effect on an election since it's unlikely that one will take the majority in a state.  
EC encourages voter apathy.  



Pro EC  
The "bunching" of electoral votes makes them worth more to a state. Example, 20 votes from one state is worth more than 4 states with 5 votes each. The 20 vote state can easily turn the election but an individual in one of the 4 states is less likely to do so. This assumes all or nothing votes which is a good assumption. (we can discuss why if you want)  



    * The EC forces candidates to cater to more interests instead of just one or a few thus appealing to a wider variety of people. A candidate just making the popular vote can do so by winning a large margin in a few states, thus winning the popular vote but not the electoral vote. With the EC, losing the popular vote but just winning in more states suggests that you appeal to voters in more states and thus more broad interests.  



    * Even though large swing states are favored, switching to a popular vote would cause the same problem except the shift would be to large "swing cities" instead of swing states. In theory, someone can win in only 11 states and win the election.(Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois, Georgia, Florida, and California) In reality, these states are geographically and politically diverse enough that they typically split pretty evenly. Winning all of them would require a major change in the population's views and loyalties making this more of an academic exercise.  



    * The enforcement of a two party system forces the dominant parties to shift to the desires of the majority. It may not seem like that now with all the polarity but this is a fairly recent situation. The two party system is meant to mitigate this sort of thing in the long run. The two parties will either centralize again or one or both will be replaced by a third party that is more moderate. Think this doesn't happen? When was the last time you saw someone run as a Whig? Also, most third parties start as regional entities. Even if they become very popular in a certain state and win that state's votes, they will not win the election until they garner broader support across the country.  
EC hides effects of regional turnout problems. If Katrina happened during an election year, most likely voter turnout in the effected areas would be terrible. This would greatly effect the popular vote since those votes were really lost. In the EC, those lost votes are only lost to the state they are in. If the division of interests in the state is relatively close to the division in the effected areas, the low turn out will not effect the outcome at all. If the division of interests is not the same, there's little to be done about that but the EC lessens the impact to only that state.  



      * A similar argument to the above is that rallying voters to a regional special interest will have less effect on the overall election results. Let's say there are big issues on the ballet relating to shipping wine across state borders. This is likely to garner a higher turn out in states that care about this sort of thing (California, Washington, etc.). Lets also assume that these states favor one candidate. This would result in a higher than normal popular vote for that candidate, not because the populace necessarily likes them more, but because of the extra voters due to the wine issue. The EC mitigates this since the extra votes have less meaning unless they are spread across lots of states.  



There are of course other pro and con arguments. These are the biggies that come to mind. Others are less relevant now. The one in that category that I can think of is that the EC maintains separation of powers. The EC elects the president. The supreme court is chosen by the president and senate. The house is chosen by the people. The bit that's less relevant is that the senate used to be chosen by the state legislatures but is now chosen by the populace. The other argument for (and perhaps against depending on your views) is an undertone to many of the above. The United States is a federal system. In the national government, the states are more important that the individuals. In the states, the individuals are more important. This is to avoid the separatism that other large countries have seen (USSR, China, etc.) The EC is a fundamental part of the federal system. The biggest opponents to the system are anti-federalists, which is fine, but it would require a rethinking of the design of the country.  



Anyway, discuss...

<p>but don't know that direct vote would be better, even though I feel that it would.  We still don't<br>
have much voter participation.  I would prefer to see preferential voting first before worrying about<br>
the preferential voting, that way people could vote their minds first, and the duopoly second.<br>
<br>
FYI you rate your candidates in order of preference....<br>
A  1<br>
B  3<br>
C  4<br>
D  2<br>
<br>
So you take everyones first preference, and the one with the least votes is removed from further<br>
rounds.<br>
<br>
With the next rounds, you take peoples remaing highest preference candidate.  The lowest<br>
is removed again, and repeat.<br>
