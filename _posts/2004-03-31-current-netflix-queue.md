<p>Yes and no. The first one is...Jenn is a big fan of Dark City but has never seen Metropolis so we are gonna watch it. The second is a new (2001) anime by Osamu Tezuka and Katsuhiro Ã”tomo. It's received some excelant reviews so I figured I'd check it out.</p>

<p>I have them both.  I figured you were talking about them both.  I figured the one with (anime) in the title was a new one.  <br>
<br>
And yes, the anime Metropolis is cool.</p>
