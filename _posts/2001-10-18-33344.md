I saw [Amores Perros](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0245712) last night. Interesting "parallel plot line" movie. About dog fighting, a guy who leaves his family to live with his mistress, and an ex-con/hitman trying to contact his daughter. Worth seeing if you liked [Pulp Fiction](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0110912). Spanish w/ English subtitles if anyone cares.
