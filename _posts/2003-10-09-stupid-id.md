Yea..so my id doesn't want to work in the LAC door swipe. I even got a new card in case my old one was on the fritz. I believe we have an idea why it might not work. This is a testament to stupid software designers.  



The UI for entering card numbers seems to treat them as integers. I believe the swipe treats them as characters. My id number begins with a zero. The UI drops the leading zero as "insignificant" so I can't actually put my id number into the system. ARGHHH!!!!
