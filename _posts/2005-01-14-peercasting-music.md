I dumped my icecast stream a while ago because it was sucking bandwidth. I just set myself up with [peercast](http://www.peercast.org) so I'm broadcasting again. If you are interesting, get [peercast](http://www.peercast.org) and click [here](http://192.168.60.21:7144/pls/2E2FC085A4DCDD087AEA89C3D07F4A00?tip=65.185.178.221:7144) for my stream. It doesn't run often for now...just when I'm home listening to something. Maybe I'll set up something more perm later.
