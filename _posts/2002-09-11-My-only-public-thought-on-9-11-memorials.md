Unlike ravenstar my experience with 9/11 memorials was not bad. I was walking from the gym to the CS building and passed RIT's candlelight vigil. It was small (about 50 people, maybe less) with some candles and a couple of interpreters at the infinity symbol. As I walked by, they started quiety singing God Bless America (a song which is musically good but I have some issues with the lyrics, but I digress). They were slightly out of tune (most people there probably are not singers) but as I moved to the other side of the quad, the accoustics took on a cathedral quality. The voices merged into one calming tenor and the song drifted on the breeze. It was very calming, unobtrusive, patriotic without being psychotic, and very appropriate. Allah and God bless those with the sense to grieve and remember but not to destroy.
