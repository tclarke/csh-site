Anyone have an old tri-band (or quad-band) GSM phone they want to sell me? Preferably unlocked. I'm looking for a phone to take on my trip to the UK and don't want to spend a ton but I also don't want a crappy phone as my mom will probably use it in the US after the trip for infrequent pre-paid service.
