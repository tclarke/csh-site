My cat died today. She was 20 years old. She had a condition where all the fat in her body broke down an liquified. It started in a large, benign tumor she had on her back so the vet removed it. Last night it started to happen to the rest of her body. The vet would have had to remove all her skin to get the liquid out and she was in a lot of pain so my parents desided to have her put down. Not really sure why all this happened (it's quite rare) but it was probably a complication related to her diabetes.
