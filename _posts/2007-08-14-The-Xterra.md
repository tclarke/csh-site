Last week I finally got the Xterra back. $2500 to fix everything but it's running great now. I still think it's time to get rid of it...so...if you know anyone interested, I'm asking $7000. I've been driving the Acura a lot because it gets great mileage but I'm probably selling that as well....depends what I can get for it. I'd like $2000 but I'd settle for less.

<p>are an good cross between fuel economy and utility.<br>
I just sold my '03, that we replaced with a minivan.<br>

There are a lot of choices out ther.</p>

<p>A lot of people really like their Saturn VUEs.  I love my Toyota RAV4.  It's a small sport-ute but it gets good gas mileage.<br>
<br>
If you trade in the Xterra, do you know anyone who would let you borrow a SUV-type vehicle if you needed to grab something big?  That would be my only concern.  When Jeff and I had the Saturn and the Neon I always had to borrow.  It is nice having my own.</p>

<p>What year is the Xterra, and how many miles are on it?  And what kind of budget are you working with?<br>
<br>
The thing that scares me is that these dealers will always give you the shaft on a trade-in.  True, the longer you wait, the less you will get... but if you're going to invest that much in having the Xterra fixed (especially if there's a chance that you may wind up putting more money into it if this repair doesn't fix it), maybe it's best to hold on to it a little longer if you can.<br>
<br>
The Subaru wagons are great, sturdy vehicles, and they're great in the snow... this one already has 72k miles on it though.  The good thing is that since they are so very well built, it will probably last you quite a while... but how long do you plan on keeping the car and how important is it to you when the mileage starts getting way up there?<br>
<br>
The Saturn VUEs are nice, I also have heard many good things about them, but I have also seen them unable to get out of their own way in the winter.  You guys don't get the same type of snow we get, but it's nothing that a good set of tires won't be able to deal with.<br>
<br>
As far as Saturns in general are concerned, I still have my 2001 SC2 with just under 80,000 miles on it, and I love it, and have had minimal problems over the past 7 years (I bought the car in 2000, but it is a model year 2001).  I've got a great set of snow tires that I put on in the winter and I can get through just about anything.<br>

You mentioned towing capacity as something you may be looking for in a new vehicle.  What would you be towing?  The reason I ask is that a lot of these smaller SUV-type deals can accept a hitch, but they really don't have much in the way of actual towing capacity.  If you want any serious towing capability, that means a larger truck, and that means gas mileage goes out the window.  There are an awful lot of people who use these large trucks primarily as commuter vehicles -- that's just nuts, especially these days, with gas prices as high as they are.  So if the towing thing is something that's "nice to have" but you don't really have a specific need for it right now, maybe it's a good idea to stick with something a little smaller and more fuel efficient.<br>
<br>
If you have something specific in mind that you want to tow, make sure you check the actual towing capacity of the vehicle, as well as the maximum tongue weight it can support.<br>
<br>
pickled_cotton has the Toyota RAV4, those are very reliable as well.  They do have a bit of towing capability, but I think we saw a discrepency between what was in the owner's manual and what was listed online for that car.<br>
<br>
Yup, there are so many options to pick from.  Having a lot of choices is good in some ways, but it sure makes things confusing as well. :)  I am in the process of starting to evaluate other vehicles too, since my car is getting a bit older.  I am in the same situation as you -- I really love my car and don't WANT to trade it in either.  However, if I started to have major problems with my SC2, I may be swayed to start looking around a little more seriously too.</p>
