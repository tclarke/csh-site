So, I've been sick all week...it's annoying...no kung-fu, no appetite, and lots of coughing. I'm watching Dr. Who now. It has some potential. This is my third episode and even though I'm not hooked, I'm interested enough to watch more.  



There's a dig tomorrow but I don't know if I'll go. First, as stated above, I'm sick. Second, Jenn has to work and these things are always more fun with her.  



Speaking of Jenn, I'm missing her a lot right now. I can't wait for her to get out of work so I can get a hug.  



BTW, I just saw a trailer for Slither.
