My mom is one of 6 kids, and <em>all</em> of them played the accordian. Lets say you start playing on Jun. 1st. I'd say there's nothing like a little 6 child accordian serenade over the span of a few days to elicit the need for National Headache Awareness Week by the 2nd week into the month. :)</p>
