<p>i'm hoping that since it's still in beta they will eventually make it a fully compatible jabber client. they did say it will eventually have full SIP compatibility, so obviously it's still in development.</p>

<p>It's not the client that's the problem. They have not enabled s2s. Reading their press release, etc. they plan on offering connectivity to "select partners" which is not right. How would you feel if, with your gmail account, you could only email other gmail users and users of say, hotmail and yahoo mail.</p>
