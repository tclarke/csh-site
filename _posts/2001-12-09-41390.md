Went to Vertex for their holiday party tonight. Free cover, free cookies, free bottle of wine, pool, darts, drinks, and one of the best sets of music they have played in a while (thanks cedric). I'm tired after dancing all night; had to force ourselves to leave of Concrete Blond started playing (at least I had that cd in the car). I'm going to sleep.
