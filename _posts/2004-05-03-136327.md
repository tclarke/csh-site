Mutherfuckers!!  



I had new tires put on the truck at sears a while back. The truck is now out of the garage and I'm putting new brake pads on it. Seems that whoever did the tires crossthreaded one of my lugnuts. I was removing it (with the hand wrench, not an air wrench) and it sheered off. I am now missing one lug bolt.
