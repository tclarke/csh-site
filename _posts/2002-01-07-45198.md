It's been a while since I've posted anything of substance. Well, one of the big things that has been on my mind is resolved. I was unsure if I was going to pass the optics course I took at [UofR](http://www.rochester.edu). It was pretty difficult especially for someone who hasn't had a real physics course since high school. Anyway, the grade arrived and I got a C- !!! I've never been so happy to get one of those. Wh00t!! This means (barring a completly unforseen lapse of intelligence) I will graduate at the end of this quarter.  



Finally getting a Cyberpunk 2020 game started with Jeff, [Meg](http://www.livejournal.com/users/ravenstar), [Kim](http://www.livejournal.com/users/riffraff), and [Jenn](http://www.livejournal.com/users/klutzywaitress). We will be posting logs of each game as well as some discussions, etc. on Livejournal so watch the [rochester2020](http://www.livejournal.com/users/rochester2020) community if you are interested. It's closed but you can still read the posts.  



I'm sitting in Java's now. Just left beers of the world and I'm waiting for yoga to start (I know, [tough quarter](http://www.csh.rit.edu/~retrev/schedule.shtml)). I think I'll do some research for my distributed AI course.
