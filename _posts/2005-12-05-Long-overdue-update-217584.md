It has been quite a while and a lot of stuff has happened but I'll only cover the highlights.  



A couple of weekends ago, we hosted the fancy pant shindig. Lots of firefly folks came by and a few other friends stopped in. It was quite a success. Most of the food was gone by the time everyone left around 3am or so. We playtested the new edition of Bwah! (the Serenity version). A few issues cropped up but in general it's a good game.  



Last week, I was pretty busy at work so there wasn't too much out of the ordinary. I watched the first two DVDs in the new Aeon Flux box set. Since I worked on Sunday, I took the afternoon off on Friday. Had a doctor's appointment after lunch which was pretty routine. They took some blood to make sure everything is still good there and I don't expect any problems. We had thought about going to a matinee of Aeon Flux but decided to wait and see it with Amber and Tim.  



Jenn went to donate blood friday afternoon. She got defered because of a low hemocrit. I decided to fill out the form and do an interview. I can't give blood with the Red Cross due to the polycythemia thing a few years back but I didn't know how close the Community Blood Center's policies where. I explained that a few years ago there was a chance I had polycythemia but after some tests and about a year of observation and checkups, my doctor was not able to confirm the diagnosis and there had been no problems since. When I went to donate with the Red Cross I was in the middle of the testing so they black listed me just in case. Here, they decided that since it had been so long without a confirmed diagnosis, the risk was minimal so they let me donate.   



Saturday, Amber and Tim came over for dinner. I made some Challah and flint corn meal crusted rainbow trout. Jenn and Amber put together a salad. Jenn and I used the rest of the mushroom paté and some feta to make a spanikopita like dish. We layered the paté and cheese between some filo and baked. It was all yummy. Amber and Tim brought baklava. Originally we were going to see Aeon Flux but Tim had to work really early so we watched some episodes of the show instead of going to the movie.  



Yesterday I made french toast from the leftover Challah. There was a trip to the mall to poke a little bit and Jenn and I caught a matinee of the new Harry Potter movie. It was enjoyable; I'll not post a full review right now. National Lampoon's European Vacation was on Showtime and we watched that before bed. I finished my book and now I really want to read the last one in the series. It would be neat to get [this](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060599359/harpercollinspub/103-7955601-5441437) limited edition hard bound, signed and numbered edition. It's a bit expensive but there are some good and very good condition copies for under $70. I'll probably get the soft cover edition though. I'm not sure what I want to read after this. My mom gave me an Arthurian novel that was one of her favorites. Maybe I'll read that. There are also some R.A. Salvatore books I havn't read yet. Any ideas?
