I've been working on an obnoxious problem for a couple of days which has me stuck for most of the day in a vault so I've been pretty much cut off from email, IM, and phone. I hope I get this taken care of soon..blah



Next week is my last work week before vacation...not going to France now, it's just not in the cards so we're spending a night in London instead. We'll have a computer so I'll try to post on occasion but I expect to be too busy most of the time. I think I'm going to bring a small journal and make myself write in it at least once a day. I'm only writing on one side of each page and the other side will eventually contain a photo relating to the entry. Maybe I'll make an abridged copy in lj when I get back.
