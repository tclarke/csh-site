Ok, as many of you know, I had my entire cd collection (except for the one cd that was in my car at the time) stolen a couple of weeks back. I need your help replacing it. I'm hoping to get all the originals back but in the meantime, copys (preferably from originals not mp3s, oggs, etc) are wonderful, oggs (or mp3) if you can't burn them will work. Please peruse the partial list [here](http://www.csh.rit.edu/~retrev/lost_cds.html) and let me know if you have any. In general, stuff I value more is towards the top but that's not a hard and fast rule. I post briefly as I update the list (or keep checking the web site). Thank you in advace.
