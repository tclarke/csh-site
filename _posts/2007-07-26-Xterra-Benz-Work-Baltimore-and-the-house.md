A few updates today...first, the Xterra..it's still in the shop and the status keeps changing. First, it was a bad head gasket. They looked at the damage and thought there was a bent connecting rod...new engine needed. One of the senior mechanics decided to do some more tests first and is not sure it is a bent rod. So...they sent the heads off to be pressure tested. They came back ok so the next step is to remove the oil pan and find out why that cylinder is not lining up properly...perhaps its a bad bearing. It's looking more repairable again. If so, I'm still thinking of selling the xterra and getting something new...there's a nice WRX wagon I have my eye on. If I need to replace the engine, I'll probably keep the xterra.  



Jenn got a Mercedes. She likes it a lot and looks cute driving it. It got a bath and a wax last weekend. (so did the acura...didn't want it to feel left out)  



I've been uber busy at work lately...lots of overtime getting ready for the GEOINT conference in october...gonna demo Opticks. We had our mid-year performance reviews and I got a raise! 2.6%...pushes me over $70k  



This weekend I'll be in Baltimore, MD (Hunt Valley actually) for the USKSF tournament. I'm competing in two events...open hand intermediate forms (northern) and intermediate long weapons forms. I'll be competing with Her Chuan (Northern Shaolin crane fist) and pai mei gun (white eyebrow long staff). I'll try and get some pictures online next week.  



The living room is looking great...new furniture, new curtains, etc. I believe I'm allowed to have people over now so we'll be planning a party, next month perhaps. There are some pictures [here](http://picasaweb.google.com/pythonpimp). We've been planting again...got some more roses out front and we cleaned up the front yard a little bit.
