<p>Hey, thanks for the info on Watkins Glen.  I think I will put it on my list of things to do.  I had to replace Leonard Nemoy to make room, but that's ok.   Yeah, so I poked around in here a bit.  And now I am curious about the whole Tahous thing.  Is it a restaurant?  Hmmmm, me thinks I am missing something by never having stepped foot in New York.</p>

<p>It's more than just a restaurant!! <a href="http://www.rit.edu/~sms4468/409/tahous.html">Here's</a> a brief (although poorly spelled) intro with a picture. Imagine the best of greesy fast food, short order diner breakfasts, and greek hot sauce rolled into one heaping helping of heaven! If you ever make it out this way you must go...or...we have driven plates to people in boston, perhaps we could overnight one to you...not quite the same reheated tho (some might argue it's better..I'm not one of those people).</p>
