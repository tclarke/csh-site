Jenn and I want to go camping. Who wants to go with us? Probably the end of August or possibly early September. I'm thinking of going to Daniel Boone National Forest down in KY. It'll be for a couple of days. Backwoods camping (so no toilets, etc) but we'll not be hiking too far in..just a few miles.
