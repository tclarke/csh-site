Here's the latest emusic downloads.  
I reviewed this last month...just grabbing the last song I missed last time. It's a great unplugged song called "It's True That We Love One Another"  
Downloaded the rest of this cover album. I got Shout last month. It's a truly trippy album with a bunch of great rock and metal songs.  



There a fantastic remix of Road to Nowhere that starts off with a great industrial/noise bit and transistions into the synth heavy Rosetta Stone sound with Porl's deep vocals moving the song alone at a leisurly pace.  



Porl's version of The Spirit of the Radio is driving with the same great drum beats as the original but more feedback in the synth and guitar.  
Got the rest of this one. Just replenishing my lost collection.  
Another refiller.  
Some drum and bass. Nothing special. It's got some pretty hypnotic grooves...great coding music.
