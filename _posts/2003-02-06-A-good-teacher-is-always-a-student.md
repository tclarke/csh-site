I was walking to the CS labs after my tutoring session today when I realized something. When I was talking math classes I often had trouble with some of the finer points that I thought I understood but never quite grasped. Now that I'm tutoring someone in discrete math (covers lots of areas of math) I finally understand many of these things. I think that I'm obtaining this new level of understanding because I'm forced to find a way to relate it to another person so I spend the time on the details that I never spent before. It's easier since I don't just have to convince myself I understand something. I think I'll go home tonight and try to teach some crypto algorithms to one of my roommates. I've been having difficulty implementing some identification schemes and I think this might help a lot.
