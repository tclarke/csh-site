Friday, we got off to a late start...nearly 3 hours later than we planned. However, because of this, we missed rush hour (just a little in Dayton) and made great time. We arrived in Rochester a little after midnight.  



Saturday morning, I went to the gym at RIT hoping to see someone from Duteau's kung fu class. It was break week but sometimes people still go to work out even though there is no class. I didn't see anyone but got a good hour workout. I walked over to CSH but nobody was there so Brian picked me up and we met Jenn at Beers of the World. Got some beer. Went back to Gail's for a nap and a shower before the party.  



The dinner was great. I saw quite a few people I had not seen for many years. There were some changes (new babies for one). After the dinner we had plans to go to Vertex. We dropped Brian and Anne at home and Katie was going to meet us there since she was already in the area. Beer was had while we waited. We ended up talking for much of the night (with Katie too) so skipped the club.  



Sunday we met some people for dim sum at the Shanghai. MMMM as always! Jenn and Katie went with Gail to her class and I went to the CSH picnic. Saw a few other people and chatted for a bit. Went to floor for a little while then headed over to Brian's when he got out of work. Brian, Tim, and I bottled some beer and drank some other beer. Dinner was Pelegrinos with Brian, Tim, Yvon, and Becky. Jenn watched some of the Oscars then we went back to Gail and John's for some chit chat then bed.  



Monday we poked around town a little bit. Jenn found these ready made cosmos in a pink carry bag with pink drinking straws called Cocktails by Jenn so she had to have it. She and Katie headed to Gail and John's for a movie and some drinks. I played some D&amp;D with Brian's group. Must play more...I've missed it.  



Tuesday morning, Gail made some pancakes and eggs for us. We packed up, got showered, then headed out a little after 11. It took us a little longer to get back to Dayton but we took out time getting back.  



On to last night. Jenn dragged us all out to Pearl. It was nearly 12 so the ladies jumped out of the car at the red light to try and make it in time for no cover. I saw a parking spot on 4th so I signalled and turned but was in the center lane. The guy coming up behind me was going faster than I thought and hit me. My driver side doors are dented but they still open fine. My nerf bar bent forward and was rubbing on my tire but we were able to remove it so I can drive the car. (thanks Tim!) The other car has a dent just behind his headlight on the corner. Nothing really serious. I put in an insurance claim and I'll be dropping off the car on monday at the body shop. I'm getting a rental for a few days. I'm sure this will raise my insurance premium but hopefully not by much as I havn't made any claims in quite a few years. I admitted fault and got the "short form" instead of a full investigation. It was that, or get a citation for a lane change violation as well. Since I was changing lanes it was pretty straight forward and my insurance rep said that was a good choice as he'd agree with the police. Oh well...que sera.
