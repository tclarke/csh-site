So, the Tianjin University of Technology wu su team is at RIT this week. I went to a workshop they ran today and learned some neat spear techniques. They are performing tonight (wed) and sat at RIT. (7:00 at the LBJ and 6:00 at the ice arena respectively) If you are in Rochester, I suggest checking them out. It's only $5 and this is a championship team. Well, time for dinner, then the show.
