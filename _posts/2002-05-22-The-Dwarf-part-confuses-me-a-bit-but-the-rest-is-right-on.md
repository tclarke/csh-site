**I Am A:** True Neutral Dwarf Bard Ranger



_Alignment:_  
**True Neutral** characters are very rare. They believe that balance is the most important thing, and will not side with any other force. They will do whatever is necessary to preserve that balance, even if it means switching allegiances suddenly.



_Race:_  
**Dwarves** are short and stout, and easily recognizable by their well-cared-for beards. They are hard workers, and adept at stonework and engineering. They tend to live apart from other races; generally in deep, underground excavated systems, and as such tend to be distant from other races.



_Primary Class:_  
**Bards** are the entertainers. They sing, dance, and play instruments to make other people happy, and, frequently, make money. They also tend to dabble in magic a bit.



_Secondary Class:_  
**Rangers** are the defenders of nature and the elements. They are in tune with the Earth, and work to keep it safe and healthy.



_Deity:_  
**Dumathoin** is the True Neutral dwarven god of buried wealth, ores, gems, and mining. He is also known as the Keeper of Secrets under the Mountain. His followers are typically miners and explorers, but also respect the beauty of the earth. They also stand guard over the dwarven dead. Their preferred weapon is the maul. Dumathoin's symbol is a faceted gem set inside a mountain peak.
