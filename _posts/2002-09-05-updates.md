I started work and school today. Work is dead easy but could become exhausting (4am 2 times a week, 8am a couple more days a week).  



Classes should be interesting. I had Intro to CS Theory grad style today. My prof suggested that I talk to my advisor about replacing it with another course since it will be mostly the same as a CS theory course I already took. Next was digital image processing which will be helpful and hopefully interesting. I know the prof from my work stint at CIS which is nice. Next I have algorithms with Stashek (class 2 of 3 this qtr) which is definately going to be good. A whole 20 classes of tricks and implementation fun with algorithms. The project will be kiltered towards bioinformatics (substring matching to be exact) which will be very cool.  



I'm sitting in the library waiting for Jenn. She's not here so I guess she didn't decide to skip half of her 4 hour class to go out with skyes. I'll see her at 10:00 I guess. Them home to sleep so I can get up for work tomorrow morning.
