Ugh...I'm sick....felt yucky yesterday too...sore throat all day and now I'm all stuffed up. Last night I was making some coffee and thought it looked a little weak. I opened the drip container to see if the filter got tangled up. It turns out I forgot to grind the beans.  



Anyway, friday and sunday were caterings. Friday didn't go too well...got there and the stoves were off and we weren't going to get them lit and going in time so I had to run to target and get some glad ware to microwave everything. It was just me so it was really hectic. Sunday's could not have gone better. The clietns were really happy with the food and service. It felt good to not get yelled at for a change.  



Saturday I slept in and didn't do a heck of a lot.  



Yesterday I had the holiday off. Jenn and I went to Columbus to pick up a desk she bought. We drove around the city for a little bit, got some bubble tea, poked around the Apple Store and the fancy cooking store at Eastgate Commons. Jenn found a laptop back she wants...it's a little on the pricey side but it's pretty big and has a separate laptop "sleeve" if you don't need lot of accessories. Maybe for Christmas or birthday. She got Sims 2 as well....slightly delayed aniversary gift (I kept forgetting the card I was using to pay for part of it). She's quite happy to have it.  



Today is not too difficult...merging lots of branches into the latest code trunk so it's a mind numbing day but my mind is already numb so I'm not complaining. I'm also thinking about some improvements for the software. Finally got over to the base and shadowed some of the thermal analysts. They don't use lots of features but there are quite a few "little" things we can do to speed up their workflow.  



Anyway, it's almost lunch time so I'm going to get back to work now.
