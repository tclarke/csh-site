Your a native Rhode Islander and you know you're not in Rhode Island if:



**Your new friends start asking you to repeat words such as car, potato, pizza, barber, and chowder.**



**You see a car with RI plates and you have an uncontrollable urge to ask, "What pot?"**



**You ask a friend who's going to Rhode Island to bring back some Saugy's and/or hot weenies.**



**The car in front of you is using its turn signal.**



**You'd gladly shell out $35 for a black market bottle of coffee syrup!**



**You've driven 5 miles in a populous area and have not seen a Dunkin' Donuts.**



**You ask the waitress for a grinder and she gives you directions to Home Depot or Lowe's.**



No one wishes you a Happy St. Joseph's day.



**You don't get VJ day off from work.**



**When you say that you have a "great idear," people look at you funny.**



**You receive blank stares when asking where the "bubbla" is located.**



**You're reading this and pronouncing all the words like a true Rhode Islander.**



**You're proud as hell to (still) be a Roe Dylinda!**
