Ok, time for a recap of the trip. I put up some pictures but only a small amount so if there's any part of the trip you'd like to see more of, let me know.

We arrived in London and went through immigration then went off to look for my dad's cousin Ronald. He works for Avis and arranged for us to have a car. We decided to be stupid Americans and met him waving miniature US flags. Jenn needed to find some allergy medicine and went off to look. A few minutes later she came back down the elevator and was already giving someone else directions around Heathrow!  



Our first stop was The White Horse to let them know we'd be showing up with a lot of people on Friday then off to Fleetmere for some rest. We stayed at a friend of Ronald's (he was house sitting while she was away). It's a nice country cottage in Staines. Mom, Ronald, and I headed out to the crematorium to leave the ashes as they need to be there for 24 hours before scattering. The rest of the day was pretty uneventful.  



The next morning we were off to Windsor. We got to the castle in time to see the changing of the guard. Also got our pictures taken in front of the gate where dad had to pick up his dog after she snuck into the Queen's duck pond. Had some lunch at a local pub while waiting for Ronald to pick us up. In the afternoon we went to visit my grandfather at his nursing home. He look quite good considering his condition a few months earlier, nobody thought we would make it much longer. He has Parkinson's so we was not able to walk and can't write very well but he was full of energy and have no problems remembering anything or interacting with us.  



Friday was the memorial. The scattering was in Bassingstoke and a lot of friends and family showed up. Even some old friends/coworkers of my dad's from 35 years ago. My mom sends them a Christmas card every year but other than that we haven't seen or talked to them since my parents left England in the 70s. It was a short ceremony and we scattered the ashes in the same spot where my grandmother was scattered. We all went to The White Horse afterwards for drinks and lunch. It's my parents' old haunt and where they first met. It's a bit fancier now than it used to be but still had a close and comfortable feel.  



On Saturday, mom and Graham stayed at the house and saw a couple of family members who could not make it on Friday while Jenn and I went to London. We stayed in a hotel right next to Paddington station. We saw a lot of the usual sites including Harrods. Jenn bought shoes there... We wandered through Belgravia and Jenn decided she wants to live there, guess I'll need a higher paying job. Dinner was at a pub near the hotel and Jenn had her first Pimms which she loved.  



Sunday started with church services in Westminster Cathedral which was neat. We did some more sightseeing including a trip up the Thames back to Waterloo. We took the train to Bassingstoke and met up with Dave and Rebecca, old friends of my parents. They had invited us for dinner which was nice as we could catch up a bit. I know them the best of my parent's friends in England since they used to visit us often in RI. They even made it out for our wedding.  



Monday began our trip north. It had been very nice out all week but Monday was very raining and windy; 60mph winds on the plains. We had a very quick (30 seconds or so) stop at Stonehenge then on to The Yew Tree Inn for some fantastic lunch. We stayed the night at a nice b&amp;b; called The Mill House.  



The next day lead us to Stratford-upon-Avon and Warwick Castle. Warwick castle is a renovated medieval castle that has a year round ren faire. We saw the usual jousting, etc. and got some good pictures. Later that day we walked around Sherwood Forest. The ancient oaks are something you need to see to believe. The whole area feels alive.  



Wednesday we were in Sheffield at The Fat Cat, sister pub to The Old Toad. Had a pint from the local brewery and swapped some Old Toad matches for some Fat Cat coasters. After that, we were off to York which was very busy and a bit of a disappointment for me. Tea time at Betty's in Harrogate was awesome. We had a full afternoon tea and did a little shopping before we made our way north.  



Thursday was one of my favorite days. We spent the morning in Richmond which had some castle ruins, an old medieval town, and an operating Georgian theater. If I ever move to England I think I'd like to live somewhere in north Yorkshire. In the afternoon we had tea in a shop build on the remains of Hadrian's wall. We saw part of the wall and had a lovely drive through Northumbria. We jetted up into Sctoland and to Milngavie where we were based the rest of the trip. The weather was a bit cloudy and damp after that first day of rain but overall pretty good. Once we got to Scotland it was sunny again until the day we left when it got a bit cloudy.  



Friday we took it easy and went into Glasgow for a while. The Glasgow School of Art was closed while students set up for their finals but we did get to go to the Willow Tea Rooms. We had dinner with friends in Milngavie and I had some tasty single malts, Clynelish and Lagavulin 16 year.  



Saturday was our day in Edinburgh. Did the castle and the Royal Mile. Lots of pictures but not much to talk about. When we got to the area with the street performers Jenn had her cards read and I got my picture taken with an impressive living statue.  



Sunday was our whirlwind tour of the Highlands. We started with the Falkirk Wheel which would get all my engineer friends lathered up. We drove by Stirling castle and on to the Beatrix Potter museum. Jenn, mom, and I did a tour of Edradour distillery and had some samples then we headed north to Inverness. Culloden has a new visitors center so we stopped there and looked around. When we turned south we skipped the larger road on the western side of Loch Ness and opted for the single lane one on the east. It was well worth the extra time. Jenn dipped her feet in Loch Ness and we saw the Falls of Foyers, site of the first hydroelectric plant in Britain. At the southern end of the Loch we passed through a preserve of some sort. It was a start misty hilltop with dozens of deer grazing right next to the road. We header further south and had dinner at the Clan MacDuff Hotel near Fort William. It had a fantastic view of Loch Linney and great food. It was getting late so we pushed on past the big mountains. (including Ben Nevis, largest in Britain and quite a sight) We passed through Rannoch Moor which was probably the most stunning scenery of the entire trip. The sun was setting beyond the mountains behind us and lit of the sky with a brilliant orange-red. All around were the moors which were slightly flooded. The air was filled with the earthy peat. The starkness was a bit unnerving and you could almost here the Hound baying in the distance. We had hoped to drive south past Loch Lomond but the road was closed at night due to construction so we had to head east towards Stirling then double back to Milngavie. We arrived at the hotel just after midnight, our longest day.  



The next day, Brian (the friend in Milngavie) took us on a tour of Loch Lomond. He's a retired professor so he has access to the school's golf club. I think he pays a hundred pounds a year of so for the membership compared to the forty thousand or so you pay around the corner at Loch Lomond Golf Club. The club house is Ross Priory which is a beautiful building right on the Loch. We did a little shopping and sight seeing at Loch Lomond Shores then went about half way up the Loch to Luss. It's a conservation village so we looked around, went to the pier, and had some tea.  



Tuesday was our travel day. We had one last full English breakfast with Brian and Dorothy and headed towards the airport. The plane left in the afternoon so we had time to stop at the House for an Art Lover. It was build a few years ago based on Charles Rainey Macintosh's designs. Had a little tea before returning the car and jumping on the plane back to Philadelphia. It was cloudy most of the trip but we did get to see a little bit of Iceland. Arrived almost an hour early but had to wait on the tarmac for a gate to free up. Our flight back to Providence was delayed an hour but we eventually made it back.  



My aunt and uncle from Utah were visiting and I was glad to see them. Jenn got to visit her dad, brother, and aunt on the Cape for dinner Wednesday night and I know she was happy about that. Thursday we were back in Dayton ready for a rest from our long vacation.

<p>North Yorkshire was actually pretty nice to live in for eleven months...  we lived in Kirkbymoorside (YO62 6BA) and Whitby (YO22 4FE).<br>
<br>
Which way did you guys go up to Inverness?  We did the A9 up, but came back the A82 and A85.</p>

<p>We didn't make it over to Whitby, stuck to the middle more (Harrogate). Drove on the A9 to Inverness....great ride. Back to Glasgow we drove the B852-&gt;A82-&gt;A85-&gt;A84-&gt;A81....it's a bit roundabout but that's because of the road closing.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, what was the B852-side of Loch Ness like?  Less commercial/touristy?<br>
<br>
I still need to upload our pictures from our time over there -- although I was working most of the time, we did get out to see some stuff (including Basingstoke -- but we went there to see an RIT alum play for the local ice hockey team there).</p>

<p>Very much less touristy....mostly a single lane road. Gorgeous, especially the falls. I'd definitely go that way again if I get the chance.</p>
