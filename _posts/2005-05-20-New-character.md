Here's a new Deliria character I've just made. I'll put it behind a cut in case you'd like to figure out the details yourself.  



Wen Long Zhang (born in 1985 - year of the dragon) is a quiet, unassuming Chinese boy. He is short, about 5'4" and has a small build but appears fit. His most notable features are his short, jet black hair and nearly black eyes. He usually wears glasses with thin, black frames. He dresses and acts like most of the asian students at the university. In short, he's studious, polite, and wholely unremarkable. His family and few friends often call him Li Wu, a nickname his mother gave him when he was born.  



Wen is a third year chemical engineering major at Caltech. Originally from Hekou, Wen moved to California for school. He's currently a 4.0 student and plans on returning to China to help design soil improvement and water treatment systems for rural areas of the country, particularly Yunnan province where his family lives.  



Wen has five cousins who were born the same year as he. They all share the generational name Long meaning dragon, the year they were born. Wen is very close to these extended brothers and sisters and frequently writes them. Recently, a member of the family saved enough money to purchase a computer and the Internet has become an invaluable resource for staying in touch.  



Most of Wen's time is spent studying. What little free time he has is spent talking to family on the Internet and practicing tai chi. Wen's father is an accomplished tai chi master and has been teaching Wen since he was a small child. Tai chi is a means of relaxation and focus for Wen but has also helped him defensively the few times he's run into trouble in Los Angeles.  



Wen's passions include his extended family and his studies (and ultimately his career helping the poor in China).  



Wen has many obstacles in his life. His family, although they live fairly well by rural China standards, is quite poor. He is at Caltech due to grants and scholarships from the Chinese government and the University. Wen often found himself on the sidelines growing up because of his large family. This caused him to become very shy and un-aggressive. Wen finds it difficult to get things accomplished in fast paced, high pressure American society.  



Wen uses his tai chi for relaxation and focus. Students and teachers often see him in the quad early in the morning practicing. Most don't know that he's quite adept at the martial applications of tai chi and more than capable of defending himself and others. His small frame hides a powerful and quick dragon. Wen's father was a member of the resistance during the communist revolution in China. He was never caught but if the government knew, he would likely be arrested. Wen could get in a lot of trouble just for knowing this and not turning his father in to the authorities. Wen tries to be a good citizen but does not want to see his father arrested so he keeps this secret even tho it causes him great personal distress at times.
