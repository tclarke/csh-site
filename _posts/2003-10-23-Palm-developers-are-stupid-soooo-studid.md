Went to install Jenn's Zire software on her 'puter. Her setup is a little wierd because of some update/drive swap stuff that happened. Her boot volume is e: and her secondary disk is h: Notice, no c: which win2k has no problem with.  



So, I start the Zire installed and it complains that there is no c: and gives me the option of a) Exit the installer b) sit on my thumb and rotate. Stupid people had to hard code c: into the installer. ARGGGGG!!!!!
