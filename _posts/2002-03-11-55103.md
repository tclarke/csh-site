Lots of role playing this weekend. I played in a fairly new [3e](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/main.asp?x=dnd/welcome,3) game, my first with the new edition. As many people have come to realize, it's a pretty good system and I think I'm going to like it.  



I also ran an introductory session for a [Cyberpunk 2020](http://www.talsorian.com/cpindex.shtml) game I'm starting. We are looking for more players in the rochester area so if yo uare interested, let me know. You can see logs and things on livejournal, rochester2020.
