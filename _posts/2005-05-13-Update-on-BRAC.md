The BRAC (base relocation and closing) official report was released a little while ago. The group I work for (NASIC) is not moving....there was a chance it would either go to Huntsville or Boston. Only one group in my office is directly affected by the recomendation as their customer is moving to Hanscom...not sure what that means for them now.  



UPDATE: Just noticed that the report mentions some intelligence division relocations and the details are classified. So...we may not be safe yet...and probably won't find out about it for quite some time if it is class.
