I'm sitting outside Sinclair waiting for Jenn. She's been working on her project all night and I'm supposed to get her about 10....havn't been able to reach her on the phone so I'm sitting in the car internetting via Dayton's muniwifi. Had quite a workout at kung fu tonight; lots of stance work, etc. I'm ready to head home and veg for a while...maybe I'll call jenn again...hopefully her phone didn't run out of batteries...



Also, anybody in Dayton not have a place to go for thanksgiving dinner? It's just jenn and I this year but we could probably make room for a stragler or two if there's a need.
