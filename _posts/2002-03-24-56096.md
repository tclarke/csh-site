Power was finally turned on yesterday...I'm too stressed to say more about it now. GRRRR  



Went to Simcon at the UofR last night. klutzywaitress went too. We played Cyberpunk for a while then Jenn continued the CP2020 game and I joined the all-night Vampire larp. A good time was had even tho we left halfway through the larp.
