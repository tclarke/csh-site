I just saw an add on Comedy Central for the BMW Hydrogen 7. Limit release (only 100) but commercial. It has a combusion engine for gasoline or hydrogen use and it has a hydrogen fuel cell. More gimick at this point due to extremely small production but one of the big auto companies has finally released a commercial fuel cell passanger car.
