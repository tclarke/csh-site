Friday, Jenn and I got some work done on the car. Rotated the tires, got an alignment, and had the rear drums turned. I need to go to the dealer now to get the parking brake fixed....the cable is all stretched out and I need a replacement but I have to order it from the dealer. Next, we went to Scorceses (sp?) for dinner. It was very good although the prices were a little high for the atmosphere. It felt like a $10-$20 place but most of the menu was in the $18-$25 range (except the pastas which were around $13 each). I would go back but I would not frequent it. After dinner, we went to Target and bought a new grill. It's pretty nice although there were aÂ  couple of issues assembling it. It was missing a bolt for one of the side pieces but it's still works w/o it so I can get a new one later. I also notices a dent in the front that may have been there when we got it or we may have put it there while assembling. Either way, we decided it's too much of a pain to return it so we'll deal.  



Saturday morning I went to Tai Chi and Kung Fu. Devin and Gisel were there and Tai Chi was good. I learned some new things for my next sash in Kung Fu and got to instruct a little bit which is something I missed since moving. Saturday night we were going to go to a movie but decided beer was a better choice. Jenn called Gisel and it turns how she, Amy, and Devin were on their way to a bar. We decided to meet up with them and had a pretty good evening. Oh, and I worked for a few hours to get caught up.  



Sunday involved more work in the morning. After that, I started getting ready for the cookout while Jenn went to choir practice. I did some work in the yard (mulching mostly) and prepped some food. Vacuumed and picked up around the house. Our guests arrived as we were finishing the deviled eggs and fruit salad....just in time to help out. Tossed some shrimp on the barbie, cooked up a little Indian inspired grilled chicken and some metts. Add in some yummy deserts and it was quite the meal. We watched Dazed and Confused and the normal Sunday night lineup: King of the Hill, Malcom, Simpsons, Arrested Development, and we watched Desperate Housewives for the first time (Jenn has been wanting to see it and Gisel is a fan so we gave it a shot). Much fun was had. Gisel posted some pics [here](http://www.livejournal.com/users/giselc/206707.html) and [here](http://www.livejournal.com/users/giselc/206906.html).
