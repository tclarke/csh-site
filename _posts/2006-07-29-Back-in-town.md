We are back in town. Our first flight out of boston was delayed in the air and they had to hold our connection in baltimore so we wouldn't miss it. Headed home and changed for Lisa's party at the celtic fest. Had some beer and food then went home and slept. There's a catering today.  



Vacation was good, further details a little later; for now I'll just say it was a great trip and just as we were getting ready to leave for the airport, Jenn got a call. We close on the house monday afternoon!
