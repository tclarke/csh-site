Ok, I'm starting a PBC/PBEM RPG. The game system is Deliria. Simple rules so you don't need to game literature. (but it always helps) I'm going to shoot for a once a week-ish chat session and some in between play via email/forum. I'd like to have the game running by summer so we can play a chapter street theater style for those attending gencon.  



It will be a round table style game where different people will be the storyteller (GM). The st will switch each chapter and their player can either take a hiatus or become an NPC for the duration of the chapter.  



If you're interested, let me know or go to the [RPG Registry page](http://www.rpgregistry.com/gameinfo.php?GAME_ID=6558).
