Just got out of bed....I woke up around 9:30 and watched some TV. I'm going to get somethign to eat, then read for a bit.  



My struggles with my G3 laptop and Linux continue. I'm trying to get an IPsec tunnel running from behind a firewall. Any suggestions? I really wish BSD was working well on that machine. Oh well, soon I'll have 128mb of RAM in it and I can install OS-X.  



I got some more pictures developed. Some are from my strip to San Jose, some from [Brian](http://www.livejournal.com/users/fishslayer) and [Rachel's](http://www.livejournal.com/users/fuzzybunny) wedding, the rest are from my trip to [Alta](http://www.alta.com). Maybe I'll scan some in and post them.
