I went clubbing last night with [Brian](http://www.livejournal.com/users/fishslayer), [Rachel](http://www.livejournal.com/users/fuzzybunny), and [Mimi](http://www.livejournal.com/users/gemineyemimi). I've got a sore neck and I'm tired. Guess I'm getting too old for this...oh well, I had a good time, I'm glad Brian started feeling better by the end of the night. Think I'll go write some [PHP](http://www.php.net)


<div id="comments"><h4>Comments:</h4><div class="lj-comments"><ul>

<p>php should not be a link to pgp.net should it?</p>
