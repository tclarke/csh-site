It's not often that a new, really good programming tool comes around. Today I found one worth recomending. There are many good diff utils out there but they are usually designed as merge tools for version control systems so they do file comparisons. Comparing and merging whole directory trees, I've found, can be tedious. I found a shareware (yes...it's windows....but I won't hold that against it) tool which does directory and file comparisons and is very good at it. Merging is a snap and it uses rule based camparisons for many file types so it can detect "minor" changes (such as the addition of comments in the revision log part of a source file) and optionally ignore them. It's called Beyond Compare 2. I suggest you try it out. It has a 30 day trial and is $30 to purchase...well worth it.
