Well, something happened tonight that I have mixxed feelings about. I sorta hooked up with someone my friend likes, and has been pursuing. On the one hand, I'm happy to be starting a new relationship (hopefully a good one this time) but I really don't want to hurt my friend. I've decided that if all hell breaks loose and I need to make "the decision" I have to keep my friendship but I don't even want to think of this possibility. Guess I'll see what happens. Think I'll keep this post private at least until I discuss this with all involved.
