I passed my kung fu test last night. Jenn got a lot of pictures but I haven't had time to upload them yet so stay tuned. It went fairly well. A few week stances and some hesitation on my week side on a couple of the self defenses but a solid B. (grading is 80-86 C, 87-93 B, and 94-100 A).  



Tomorrow's my last day at work before vacation..I'm getting antsy now. Saturday morning we fly to RI. Sunday, Jenn is going to watch my aunt whose in this years Mrs. Rhode Island pagent. I'll be putting together some shelves for my mom and fixing her lawn mower so the grass gets cut before the trip. Monday will be for last minute errands. Tuesday, it's off to London.  



Once in England, we're dropping my dad's ashes off at the memorial park where his mom was scattered. (part of the trip is to see his family and scatter some ashes with his mom) We'll make sure all the arrangements are set for the get together on Friday. Thursday we'll be visiting my grandfather (my dad's step dad) who is in a nursing home. We hear he's not terribly alert these days so we're hoping he'll be having a good day while we are there. Friday, we're off to my dad's old local pub for drinks with family and friends. It's a tiny place so we'll probably go to another favorite pub of his after for lunch...it has more seating. Saturday is open for family who can't make it on Friday. In the afternoon, Jenn and I are off to London proper for the night. Sunday is a London day (my brother and mom will probably meet us in London but may take the day off if they are tired).  



Monday starts part two of the trip...driving up to Scotland. A quick trip west to Stone Henge then north past Oxford and up towards Liverpool. Shoot by the lakes district and up to Glasgow. We'll be spending a couple of days outside Glasgow visiting the area and seeing some friends of the grandfather's. My birthday will be spent in Scotland...not sure what we'll be doing. I was going to go on a distillery tour and have a nice dinner but it's a Sunday and the distilleries may not be open. Any ideas? Finally, we leave Glasgow back to the US on June 3.  



We get in Tuesday evening and probably fall asleep. My aunt and uncle from Utah will be visiting by then so I'll get to see them. My aunt was here last November so I saw her but I haven't seen my Uncle in quite a while. Jenn wants to try and get up to the Cape to visit her family. Likely this will be on Wed but she might go Saturday into Sunday before we leave for the trip. I may go with her depending on the timing (I'd like to see her family as well but I've seen them more recently than my uncle).  



Anyway, that's the whirlwind that is my life for the next three weeks.
