I've been crazy busy lately...normal work plus about 10 hours a week of OT plus two or three nights helping out at Jenn's restaurant. (one of the waitresses got in a pretty bad car accident and I'm helping out until she's back or they get another employee)Â  On top of that, I'm still going to kung fu three times a week and trying to buy a house.  



Speaking of the house, we're in the midst of contrator bids. Looks like it will need about $40k worth of work. I was hoping it would be a little less but that's still in our budget. It won't take long to do the work so we are still shooting for a mid-summer move. We will be asking for help moving when we have an exact date.  



My birthday is coming up soon (June 1st). I'm not sure what I will be doing. It's a thursday this year. Blah...gonna be 29. My last year as a 20-something.  



Some dude is outside taking pictures...not sure why...it's not an interesting building and all the classified areas have their windows blocked. Oh well...
