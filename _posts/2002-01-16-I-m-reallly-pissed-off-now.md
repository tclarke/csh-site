Damn it!!! My fscking computer is dead again. Was working fine with the new RAM I installed (crucial 256mb cas2 PC133). I shutdown to install a new SCSI card and the machine wouldn't boot. It seems to have ABITicitus (fans power, some periphs power but monitor stays in powersave, no beeps, no POST, nothing). I tried removing the SCSI card to noavail. I pulled cards and reseated RAM (in a new DIMM slot even). I pulled drives and reset the BIOS about 10 times and still nothing. I havn't reset the proc yet (this is a major pain so I put it off till last) but I think I may have to RMA the MB (from what the net says, that'll take 2-3 weeks....). This SUCKS!!!! I have projects to do and some of that stuff is on my box. (can't put the drives in another machine cause they are a RAID set and I only have on eRAID cabale computer). At least I have Linux, an OpenBSD, and a QNX b0x3n running that I can utilize for the time being(but none is faster than a P150+). GRRRRR!!!!
