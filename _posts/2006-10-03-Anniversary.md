Yesterday was [our](http://klutzywaitess.livejournal.com) first anniversary. I wen to work for an hour while Jenn was at her doctors appt. Then we went over to the house for a bit. We tried to do to the new British goods store in Dayton but they are closed mondays so we got Yummy burgers. Next, it was off to Oakwood for some tea. We went to the movies and saw Over the Hedge. It was really good...funny, good story, good cast. Sushi was had next.  



Later, I dropped Jenn at Books &amp; Co and I went to kung fu. Worked on Little Tiger Swallow for a bit. (it's the form I learned this weekend), did some self defense stuff, and worked forms full speed and got quite a work out. There's and all chinese competition near Akron the end of this month that I'd like to go to if there's time. We are also starting some fund raisers to go to grandmaster huang's tournament in Baltimore next summer.  



Over the weekend we rented a trailer and moved some furniture. The apartment is starting to look pretty empty and the cat is freaking out a little. I can't wait until we are fully moved and I can start working on some of the little things around the house. I'd like to get most of the indoor stuff done over the winter so we can concentrate on the yard during the spring. We need to do a little landscaping and I need to rebuild one of the stone walls.
