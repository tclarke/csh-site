I'm setting up a jabber server on the CSH systems and I need testers. There isn't much functionity yet, normal jabber messaging but no gateways or other plugins yet. If you want to try it out, go [here](http://www.csh.rit.edu/~retrev/jabber/), enter your username/password and fill out the form. When the account is created, point your jabber client at tempest.csh.rit.edu  



I have verified that the Exodus client works. Let me know if you have problems with your favorite client. If you have any problems or suggestions, reply here or email/IM me.
