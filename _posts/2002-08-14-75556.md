The last couple of days, I've been working for Bruce Austin (head of RIT's PTC dept) helping him rebuild the brick walkway at his house. Work starts at 8:00am (and luckily ends at 1:00pm before the heat gets bad). I got up at 6:30 this morning, had breakfast (egg, toast, and coffee), watched TV, and checked my email. Feels good to have some timein the morning. The work is hard and kinda sucks (hauling gravel, sand, and dirt up and down the steps of the existing walkway) but it's satisfying to earn a little money doing a good days work.  



In other news, my RIT grad advisor thinks I can make my go camera thingy (more info to follow later if you don't know what I'm talking about) into a thesis but it may take a little work. He said I should sign up for the thesis seminar and signed a permission form for me so off to RIT today probably.  



We now have a beige G3 running OS X downstairs. It runs suprisingly well (256mb ram is nice in a G3). We also got a phatty Explorer 8000 DVR/digital cable receiver. We are testing it for a month (it's free) and it still has some problems; mostly slow response and the occastional crash (watchdog causes a reboot I think). More to follow later.



That's about it for now.
