So, I'm finally testing for my second degree brown sash tonight in kung fu. I'm a little nervous but not too bad...it's been over a year since I last tested and I feel confident in all my material...I still tend to get nervous when I test and I'm meta-nervous now. Jenn is coming to watch me and take some pictures so I'll make another post later.

<p>Nerves are good. It's when you aren't nervous at all that you should worry.<br>

Best of luck!</p>
