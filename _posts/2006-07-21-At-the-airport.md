I'm at the Dayton airport. My 5:55pm flight is now leaving around 8:25pm. My 8:05pm out of Baltimore has become a 10:45pm out of Baltimore. My 9:35pm arrival is not a 12:08am arrival. I'm upset...why does the weather always get crappy when I need to fly. At least the T still runs that late otherwise I'd have to find another way back from Logan...with the Ted Williams out of commision, driving would suck.
