Hmm, [this](http://spl.haxial.net/gnu-gpl/) is a resonable rant on the GPL and FSF and why it is hypocritical, malformed, inconsistent, and all in all a Bad Thingâ„¢ . Don't get me wrong, I'm all for open source and code freedom but the GPL is not the way to get there. I'll save my full rant for another time (IM me if you need to hear it now).
