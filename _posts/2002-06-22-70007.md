It's been a hectic couple of weeks. fishslayer and riffraff are almost moved in (just have a couple of things to get out of the garage). Neverwinter Nights is VERY pretty. Too bad I can't really play yet. Brian and I and a few other ppl are gonna multiplayer the plot and his new computer is out of order until at least monday. I've been neglecting some of my other friends because I've been busy and I really should do something with some of them. Maybe next week...  



That's really all for now...stay tuned to this station.
