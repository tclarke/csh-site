Jenn and I are back in Dayton. I'm working today but it'll be a short day...just enough to get caught up on emails and paperwork so I can start fresh on monday. The trip was great...got lots of pictures (nearly 1300). I need to sort through them and decide what I want to post so it'll be a while until I get anything online. I'm debating if I should post a brief recap of the trip, something more detailed, or transcribe my travel journal (complete with associated pics) online. The weather was good, 60s and 70s with sun the first few days. The monday we started heading north was very rainy. The wind gusts near stone henge were 60mph. We quickly ruined two umbrellas and spent about 20 seconds looking at stone henge from behind the fence. The rest of the trip the weather was better, cloudy with an occasional drizzle then back to sunny when we got to Scotland.  



Also, happy birthday to the plethora of friends with birthdays over the last few weeks. Mine was spent driving through the Scottish Highlands.
