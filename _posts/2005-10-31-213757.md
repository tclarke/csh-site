Friday night we went to the opera to see Carmen. Great performance for bargin basement prices. (half off for students) Saturday involved a little cleaning and some costume making. That night we went down to cinci with elementalamber to a shindig. Jenn won the best costume prize and a good time want had. Sunday, we went to King Island (for free..thanks Jenn) and rode some rollercoasters. The night ended with sushi and sake at Sushi Cafe. There will be costume pics when we get some.
