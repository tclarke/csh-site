    These kids today...  



    Back in my day, we would have been THRILLED to have 25 megahertz.  



    We had 4.77Mhz. And 300 baud modems. And our packets had to go  
    uphill. Both ways.  



    Why, on some days the phone lines would go down, and we'd have to  
    carry our packets BY HAND. Barefoot. In six feet of snow. Uphill. Both  
    ways.  



    When it got really bad, we'd run out of zeroes and have to use the letter O.  
    Boy, you've never seen a harried programmer until you see one that has to  
    hack something out using nothing but O and l. UBW.
