I just got back from PLT. We talked about typing today. I've made quite a bit of progress on my thesis project today and I have a meeting tomorrow about it. Afterwards I get to meet a new professorial candidate and talk about my thesis. I'm pretty excited because I like getting feedback from the community about it. I'm just winding down before bed but I can't seem to shut down this music. I loaded all Tim's and my Pearl Jam. It's been I while since I've listened to them. I was disheartened with Vs. but all said I really like them. I wish I had a boot from the concert I saw this summer but it was the one PJ concert where they didn't allow taping (it was a promotional web cast thing). The web cast was Real so I couldn't easily record it. Still searching the net for a copy. One more song then bed.
