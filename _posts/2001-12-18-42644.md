Here I am in Java's. I have a meat and green stuff sandwich in my bag, lots of books and no desire to work. I shoudn't have brought the novel I'm reading but I knew I'd find another way to procrastinate if I hadn't so I figured I may as well be somewhat productive. I need to study for an Optics final on thursday. I hope it doesn't kick my ass like the homework has been doing. I'm probably worrying unnecessarily as usual.  



Finished Lain last night. My second time through, I picked up some references and allusions that I missed, especially near the beginning of the series. Still an enjoyable series.  



Oh well, back to the grindstone.
