So, I spent the last 12 hours dealing with stupid people, especially the guy who was mad that we wouldn't give him a discount because he's a travel agent. He started yelling and swearing and beating the window forcefully and didn't leave until we had called the police. I came home hoping to get some sleep and found a bunch of dirty dishes (still hadn't been cleaned from yesterday), dinner still in the oven, no ice cubes (because people are too lazy to dump cubes in the bucket and refil the trays when the bucket is empty), the salt and pepper mills knocked on the floor by norton (the pepper mill is still missing). I just want to go to sleep and not wake up for a long time.
