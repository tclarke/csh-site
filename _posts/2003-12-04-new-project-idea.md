Ok, when I have time (standard disclaimer), I want to create an agent framework for Jabber. The idea is that you have intelligent agents login to jabber with low priority and different resource IDs. Someone can then IM you with a question such as "Where are you?" or "Let's go to dinner tonight." If you are unavailable, the message is routed to an NLP agent (if available) which determines that both these questions require your calender and forwards then to a calendar agent. That agent either: checks your schedule and replies with your current location, or checks your schedule for a free time around dinner and replies with "Sure, how about 6:30 tonight?"  



Any thought? Any interest?

<p>I've been helping a friend write an AIM based MUD.  You IM it a command and it checks your status in the system and sends a response.  General navigation and room interaction works.  We've been discussing combat and hit point regeneration.  Hashed out the 'quest' concept too. <br>

Written in Perl, pretty straightforward.</p>
