so, the windows are finally in. Roof isn't done but it's been raining so that's understandable. Hopefully, they'll start the kitchen and bathroom tomorrow or monday. Jenn hates the windows. They are standard replacement windows. White border, nothing fancy. I think she was hoping for windows that better matched the originals (which were gorgeous). We'll do something to make them look better. Maybe put some wood trim or shutters on the outside to make them look a little nicer. Anyway, we're slowly moving stuff a little at a time but we'll still need to make a massive funiture move one day which brings me to the next question.  



Does anyone want to help us move? Probably next saturday but we might be able to shift it mid-week sometime or even sunday...I need some strong people who can help move the heavy furniture, etc. Also, pickup trucks would be great so I won't have to make as many trips with the trailer. Finally, if anyone has a car trailer that can move the MG I'll be forever in your debt...I'm trying to avoid paying someone $75 to tow it.

<p>hmm, if you (or a family member) have AAA, you can have them tow it for up to n miles (where n is either 50, 100, or 200... can't remember).</p>
