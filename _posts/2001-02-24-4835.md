today was crappy...I had to get up and go to a 9:15 exam which was really hard and I probably failed it. Before the exam I went to my office, my machine was hung and one of my disk partitions was somewhat hosed. I think it has something to do with softupdates so I turned them off. I just spend the last hour sorting through the lost+found and trying to restore everything...at least it was just application binaries and data files, I just reinstalled them. I want to go buy an A/V receiver today but I really can't afford to...maybe I will get a tv first, $500 is a little more managable than $1500. Oh well....at least the quarter is over now.
