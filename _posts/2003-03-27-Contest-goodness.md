Time for an update, and what an update. School is going well. Work is yucki but that's no different. Looks like I got some contract work with a company doing some genetic algorithm stuff. I won a couple of contests recently, couple of days ago I got a free t-shirt from the ABit MAX3 contest. Before that I won a contest at the House of Guitars. klutzywaitress and I are going to Orlando the end of April to see Pearl Jam, most expenses paid (gotta pay for airport<->hotel transport food and other "incidentals" but the big stuff is convered). Yay me!
