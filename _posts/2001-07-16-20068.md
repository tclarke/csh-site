I got back from Cleveland last night. I went with [Brian](http://www.livejournal.com/users/fishslayer/) and [Rachel](http://www.livejournal.com/users/fuzzybunny/) so I could do some work for [notcows](http://www.notcows.com). Got quite a bit done then hung out with their extended family at a reunion. I woke up about 7:30 saturday and went to sleep about 2:00 in the morning, then I woke up at 6:30 on sunday and drove 6 hours back to Rochester so, needless to say, I crashed when I got home.  



Things on the homefront are less than perfect. I have a ton of work to do this week including a paper, a lab, reading 6 or so philosophy papers, and assorted other bits. I have to talk to my roommate about rent, etc. I am sick of not getting it and it's time to make a stand since I just bounced a check. I need to just get this week finished with..grrr
