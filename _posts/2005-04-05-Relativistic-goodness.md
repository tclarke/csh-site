I just read a back-of-the-envelope proof as to why relativistic computing won't work in practice. The ideaÂ  is, you have a computation that will take a very long time (exponentially long in fact) and can't be rewritten to be solved in polynomial time. (I.E. NP) So, you start a computer solving the problem, jump in a spaceshipand fly at relativistic speeds. When you return, the computer has solved the problem. (although all your colleagues are long dead). The problem is, energy storage densities are finite. As the problem's size increases (exponentially), you need to travel exponentially closer to the speed of light to see the solution in your (slowed down) lifetime. Getting that much closer takes exponentially more energy and thus exponentially more fuel. The fuel tank is exponentially larger and thus the fuel at the far side of the tank takes exponentially longer to reach the engine. Therefore, accelleration is exponentially slower so the time it takes for you to get up to speed then back down is roughly the same order as the time it would take to do this at a slower speed and therefore you will die of old age before the computation finishes.  



Of course, Malament and Hogarth have constructed alternate space time realities where you can traval for a finite proper time along one worldline and the the _entire infinite past_ of another worldline. Thus, in theory, you could begin the computation, stop the computation, travel for a bit and view the entire past of the worldline where you did not stop the computation and therefore will have the answer to the problem.  



"An interesting property of relativity is that it is always _you_ who has to go somewhere or do something in these proposals, while the computer stays behind. Conversely, if you wanted more time to think about what to say next in a conversation, then your conversational partner is the one who would have to be placed in a spaceship." -- Acott Aaronson
