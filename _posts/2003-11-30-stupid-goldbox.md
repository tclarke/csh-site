Never gives me anything good....today (when I have rent and bills due and can't afford anything) I get "Fargo (Special Edition) $16 and "Wusthof Grad Prix 7-piece knife block set" $221 (50% off MSRP).

<p>I get good stuff.<br>
<br>
I got the Monty Python Flying Circus box set, Stargate SG1 season 4 box, and The Charlie Chaplin Collection vol 1 offered to me in my gold box.  <br>
<br>
I bought the Chaplin collection, but I click pass too quickly on the monty python box.  ARGH!</p>
