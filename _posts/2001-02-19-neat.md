I learned a couple of interesting things in discrete math today. Can't believe I didn't think of the first one before.  



(n k) <\- n choose k  



(n k) = n!/(k!(n-k)!)  
but, expanding the factorials, we get  
(n k) = (n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-k+1))/k!  
this makes things easier to work with, but it also allows us to define (n/m k) and (-n k). Further, (-n k) can be further simplified to  



(-n k) = (-1)^k * ((n+k-1) k)  



neat huh?



second, we can find non-standard dice numberings that are statistically equivilant to standard numbered dice using polynomial factoring. ndx means throw n x-sided dice and add the results ex: 2d4 with standard numbering (1 2 3 4) is equivilant to throwing two 4-sided dice with the numberings (1 3 3 5) and (1 2 2 3)  



the standard numbering (4 3 2 1) can be expressed as:  
x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x  
= x(1+x+x^2+x3)  
= x((x^4-1)/(x-1)) geometric series  
= x(((x^2-1)(x^2+1))/(x-1))  
= (x(x+1)(x^2+1))^2  
factor into two unequal terms  
= x(x+1)^2 and x(x^2+1)2  
= x(x^2+2x+1) x(x^4+2x^2+1)  
= x^3+2x^2+x x^5+x^3+x^3+x  
= x^3+x^2+x^2+x  



the exponants are the dice numbering  
i.e.: 3 2 2 1 5 3 3 1  



[Dr. Hart](http://www.rit.edu/~dshsma/hart.html) is cool.
