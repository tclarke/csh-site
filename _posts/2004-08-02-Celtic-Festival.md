Jenn and I went to the United Irish of Dayton Celtic festival on saturday. It was great fun. We saw Changeling, caught a bit of TÃ©ada, lots of vendors, and went to the end of a celtic language lesson. (q-celtic if you are interested).  



Sunday was spent at home setting up Jenn's new computer and playing Emperor. I'm assaulting the Ordos homeworld currently....I thought the Ordos home territory on Dune was a long fight, I played the homeworld level for about 45 minutes yesterday and I was just reaching the gates of their plateu and was barely holding on to decent production.
