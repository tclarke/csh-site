I've been meaning to track down my friend Chris for a few weeks. Today I got an email from him. I went to HS with him and he went to school in Rochester as well (UofR). He's working for a Representative in DC now. Not surprising...  



It's strange how you always seem to be in sync with old friends even if you havn't talked to them in a while.
