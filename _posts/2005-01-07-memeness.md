**Take the first sentence from the first entry of each month in 2004 and put it in a paragraph.**   
Goodness in my belly. Jenn and I saw Love Actually last night. HaHa! Sometimes I wish I was someplace where I can order a large coffee, regular and they know what I mean. WHOO!! I have the Interweb again! I've closed out all my bugs for last week and our monday morning team meeting is rescheduled for tomorrow....bored. Jenn and I went to the United Irish of Dayton Celtic festival on saturday. I'm waiting for jenn to get here....so tired. BREAKING NEWS: With the eruption of Mt. St. Helens, US President George W. Bush accused God of attacking the United States with multiple WMDs over the course of the summer. Happy samhain for those so inclined. Ok, with the [announcement](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/google-labs-groups2/browse_thread/thread/7a92653357cbad54/9ae8221d8ad46b65#9ae8221d8ad46b65) of a revised Google Groups, let's play a little geek game.
