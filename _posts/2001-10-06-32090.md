What a long week. I've had tons of homework including a bug in my os2 code that keeps biting me in the butt, I can't seem to track it down. Optics is, as usual, a bitch. But I did finish my senior seminar reading for next week.  



In other news, things are looking up in one aspect of my life but are strained in another. I hope they improve soon without ruining everything else. Guess I'll have to see how they pan out. *sigh* I'm making dinner tomorrow and it should be tasty but I can't reveal the menu yet (I haven't completely planned it yet).  



Why do things have to be so complicated all the time. I wish I had a break every once in a while.
