So, I'm sitting here waiting for klutzywaitress to get out of  
the shower and I realized I havn't posted in a while. Then again, after that  
onslaught the other day, a couple of days off is good for my carpal tunnel.  



Anyway, I got my DAI test back (the one that took like 12 hours to do) and I  
got a 95.5% which I'm real happy about. What makes me more happy? We had to do  
four out of five questions but if we did all five, the prof would grade them  
all and use the best four for our grade. Everyone did problems 1--3 and most  
people did 4. One or two peopl did 5 and not 4 and five people did all the  
problems. I did very well on problem 5 (lots of proofs) with 25/25 points.  
Also got 25/25 on problem 2. My next highest was problem 4 with 23/25, then  
problem 1 with 22.5/25. Finally, problem 3 (the one that didn't count) I got  
22/25, so very consistent overall.  



Now, I have lots of work to do today (and hopefully not this weekend). I have  
DAI homework (two programs to write and a multi-part problem to do). I have to  
partially implement the Interface classes for my SE project as well as do team  
leader stuff like chase down people who havn't done their work. I also have a  
DAI project due in a couple of weeks that I should work on and a paper for  
foods of the world that I should write. Finally, homework for beers of the  
world (no, my homework in not to drink lots of beer). Grrr. I'm gonna hate  
today. I'll just camp out in the labs I guess.
