[This](http://www.livejournal.com/users/retrev/2003/07/10/) has some pics of me when I had black hair. Maybe I keep posting links to some of my moodier/darker posts because I've become such a bouncy childrens show host lately. :)  



Â Although nothing will quite top my [most goth picture ever](http://www.csh.rit.edu/%7Eretrev/livejournal/2002-12-19/goth.jpg)...not that there were many, I wasn't into getting my picture taken back then.
