The first journal on my list is abigail_m. Obviously she won't be answering any questions and I barely know her but I'd like to write something anyway. Abby is the best thing to happen to Kim and Robin. She brings out the best in both of them. She is going to grow up and do great things. I'll leave it here for now...perhaps in a few years I'll finish this entry when she's had some more life experiences.  



Next on my list is aurora100 . I met Gail at a D&amp;D game. She an John are friends of Tim who enlisted them for a game he was running. Gail was difficult to get to know, mostly because my only contact with her was during gaming sessions and she tends to really get into character. The person you've known for two months bears only a slight resemblance to the real Gail. The real Gail is a life toughened but not hardened person. She is one of the most compassionate people towards those who deserve love and compassion. As for those who don't she doesn't take shit. Gail is a hard worker and strongly devoted to one of the most selfless pursuits around, teaching children to appreciate life. Teachers in general are wonderful but when you teach art, music, poetry, and similar subjects, you are on a different level. Most of these skills have little direct application to many peoples' life pursuits but they are essential to everyone's well being. Art not only teaches you to draw, paint, compose, but more importantly, it teaches you how to see the world from different viewpoints, both real and abstract. I'm lucky and honored to count Gail among my friends. Now onto the questions.



  1. How did you meet John?
  2. How did you choose your career?
  3. Who is your favorite RPG character? (either one you've played, or a character in a game you DMed)
  4. If you could choose anywhere in the world to live, where would it be and why?
  5. When did you start modeling and how did you get started?
