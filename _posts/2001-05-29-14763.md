Well...I've decided to return to school full time (pending fin aid) so I can finish my degree by next may. However, I am in a conundrum, I can't afford to live without a jobby job but I don't think I'll have time for full-time school. Hmm, maybe I can get a job at a coffe shop or something, put in lots of hours, and ask the 'rents to help a bit. I hatre having to do that though as they don't have much money either. On top of that, my brother is coming to Rochester for the summer and my parents will probably have to support him as well.  



Anyone know of a job that pay $45k, offers flexible hours (telecommuting is preferable) and doesn't mind if I leave in a year? Maybe [notcows](http://www.notcows.com) will get some more work and I can support myself with that. Wishful thinking I'm afraid. Maybe I can find a 6 or 12 month coding cotract somewhere.
