If I was a work of art, I would be M. C. Escher's **_Lizards_**.



I am a bizarre juxtaposition of the real and the unreal. Based in the realm of mathematics, my two-dimensional appearance belies a complex and free-willed behaviour which both delights and confuses people.



Which work of art would _you_ be? [The Art Test](http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~mar/tests/art/)
