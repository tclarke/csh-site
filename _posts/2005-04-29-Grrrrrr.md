I hate not having money...I really wanted to go compete in this tournament tomorrow but alas I can not. We are working on getting a little more income...I'm exploring some contract opportunities and Jenn is certainly looking for work (she's been going interview crazy the last month or so). It's just annoying that I make nearly 60k and can't come up with $30 for a registration fee...although I guess a noticable amount of that income is going to retirement type pursuits so it's not all bad. Just had to rant for a minute.

<p>I think Jenn worked like 8 hours yesterday so there's $80.  She can come get the check today and maybe she'll even let you have $30 of it.</p>

<p>I totally understand.  Between my husband and I we're over 110K yet in the same boat.  Hang in there.</p>
