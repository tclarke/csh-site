I've been thinking for a long time about what I'd like to do after school. I want to get my PhD but I might have to wait until I can afford to take a couple more years to just do school stuff (living in Boston is expensive). My current thought is to work for a couple of years and get out of some debt before I accumulate more. Not sure where to go tho. Rochester is always an option if I can find work. Jenn and I have been looking all around the country for jobs and there are plenty in places I don't want to be.  



Today I had a thought. I really want to take an extended trip to the UK (to visit family, etc.) Why not go work there for a couple of years? I have dual-citizenship, why not take advantage of it? The next step is to find out what I need to do as far as paperwork since that can take a while. My research shows that I need a US passport to enter and leave the US but I might need a UK passport as well. That means that I need to prove my UK citizenship. I'm guessing that my dad's proof of citizenship and my birth certificate are enough but I need to contact the passport dept of the UK embassy to find out. The other problem is Jenn. She could get a visitation visa w/o much of a problem but how to get a work visa....this is what I expect will take some time. Any ideas? Anyone gone through something similar?

<p>I looked into moving to Ireland at one point.  The work thing is a problem.  The problem is in the EU rules.  Before a company can hire a non-EU citizen, meaning sponsor a work permit, they must first prove that they can't hire a national from that country or a citizen from an EU member country.<br>
<br>
If you marry Jenn, the situation is different.  The spouse of an EU citizen can get a work permit without incident.<br>
<br>
I know that if you have dual citizenship with Ireland, you need to get an Irish passport.  Your best bet is to contact the British Embassy in this country and get the passport and paperwork taken care of before you go.</p>
