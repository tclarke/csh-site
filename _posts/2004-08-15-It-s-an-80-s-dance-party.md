It was just before 11pm on friday and we were heading home. Jenn did not want to be home before 11 and this was still a danger, so we went the long way. In the middle of some swamp and corn fields, the radio started playing some super cheesy 80's music and I made some remark about an "all-night 80's dance party" or some such thing. The next thing I know, we are stopped on the side of the road with the doors open and the radio blasting, dancing in the streets.  



On another note, I started tai chi yesterday.
