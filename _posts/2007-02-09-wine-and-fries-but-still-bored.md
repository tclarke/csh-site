I'm sitting in Therapy Cafe drinking wine and eating fries while Jenn works. She has a 1/2 day since she works a 1/2 day tomorrow. The drug reps took the office staff out for drinks. I drove her here and I'm keeping busy while she schmoozes but I'm getting a little bored. I wanna game bad...  



Tomorrow I test for my kung fu red sash. I finally wrote my essay for the test . I had to compare Chinese and Japanese martial arts. Much more difficult than it seems at first. I'm reasonably happy with it. I wouldn't turn it in if it were for a university class but it'll do for TAMA. (lots of 10 year olds so he's more lenient :) )  



I got quite a complement in kung fu on wednesday. Master Taninco was watching us go through our weapons forms for our next test. I really nailed my long staff form (thanks to Mike for cleaning it up on Saturday). He gave me a complement, perhaps the best I've ever gotten from him. (of course it wasn't all positive...being a good master, he worked a little humility into it as well). He said there were a few minor things...some stances that could be better, and one time when I reached for the staff early on a swing...he said when I compete, this is definately my weapon, not the broadsword (which I'm definately not great with). It really made me feel good about testing tomorrow.
