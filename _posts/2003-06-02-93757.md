UGH!!!! I'm DUMB!!!  



I changed the dist dir for a project at work to . (this is where the dir .jar is build) but I forgot make clean does an rm on $dist so I lost most everything. GetDataBack restored some stuff but most of it is gone....my deadline for this is wed. Looks like I'll be busy for a while.
