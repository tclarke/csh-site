I had a realization last night. I don't like dessert. I don't dislike it and there are exceptions (holiday feasts aren't complete without dessert) and pie makes a good snack occasionally. However, whenever I get dessert, especially cake and such, I'm just going through the motions and don't really enjoy it.  



On a completely unrelated note, I have never been hypnotized (3 attempts at various hypnosis stage shows convinces me that I can't be) but I have succeessfully convinced two of the hypnotists that they had succeeded. Hmmm...strange.
