...but this one was kinda neat so I made an exception...esp since I already have plans rolling for some of these (at least in mind and heart)



| 



_**friday five**_ If you...  



**1\. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?** A tea shop with traditional English tea service and a Japanese tea house in the back.  



**2\. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell?** Perhaps a chef's store...or strange oddities and relics.  



**3\. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be?** Probably something technical such as a text book for CS but I think I'd really like to write a book on the history of my home town, or a review of changing politcal borders in a less-known region of the world such as extreme southern South America. Anything to force me to expand my knowledge of an area I'm interested in but isn't part of my daily studies.  



**4\. ...ran a school, what would you teach?** I'd run a University. Mostly a technical bend but it would have a strong liberal arts program (and it would be interesting not just have to boilerplate stuff).  



**5\. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it?** I've already written some songs but none are good enough to release on an album. They are mostly techno and industrial (EBM) type stuff which is fun to knock out when you have a few hours to spare. If I actually released an album however, it would be expressionist and late-baroque oboe and woodwind ensemble music perhaps with some of my original oboe works (not that I have anything long enough to classify as a finished product but it's a start)
