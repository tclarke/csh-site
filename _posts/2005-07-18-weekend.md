We lost power saturday night for about four hours. The storm knocked a tree down. But I did get a chance to use the oven set for my camp stove and I baked a chocolate cake. My remember to get my plate back from the neighbors. Anyway, saturday night I remembered why I havn't gotten really drunk since I was about 20. Sunday was spent in bed. I'm still not fully recovered.

I want one. My apartment only allows gas grills, though. And my roommate's little camping-grill thing is pretty wimpy.</p>
