On Saturday, we drove up to Detroit...stayed at the Marriott at the Renaissance Center (where the GM tower is). 53rd floor with a pretty good view. We had dinner in Dearborn at a Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant. Tasty food and reasonably priced. After that, we drove over to Harpo's to see Type O Negative. We missed the first opening band which was fine...had little interest in seeing them. We did catch Lordi who put on quite a good stage show. Since I don't keep up to date with the metal scene anymore I hadn't heard them even though they are quite well known (won the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest...the European version of American Idol). Very different sound and show...sort of a cross between Gwar and Kiss. Anyway...Type O played after Lordi. The set list is [here](http://www.last.fm/event/319883). I got a few pictures with my cell phone. I'm still trying to photoshop them a bit since I didn't have a flash...I'll post some later if I get any good ones. It was a great concert...they even played it's some Tom Jones! WOOT! Still..not the best concert of theirs I've seen. Peter has said he doesn't like touring as much as he used to and I think it shows. We got back to the hotel a little before 1:00 and flipped over to ESPN to catch the highlights from game 3.  



Sunday, we headed over to a fancy mall and Jenn had her fun for the weekend. Details are over [here](http://klutzywaitress.livejournal.com/527590.html). (if you are on her f-list...if not, ask her and I'm sure she'll add you) We got back to Dayton, went to Target for a bit and then headed home. Pizza and beer were on tap for the night and we plopped in front of the tube to watch game 4. Existing game! Things were dicey for a while at the end, but the Sox triumphed! Wish I was in New England right now (just like 2004)...s'ok...someone need to represent the Nation out here in Dayton.  



Back to work for me...I'll get a post with some pictures a little later tonight or tomorrow.
