I woke up fairly early and was on campus before 10:00. Spent the day in the SE  
labs working on my SE project and my DAI project.  



SE Project: we can move checkers around, sort of  
the testing module works and is kinda nice (I copied the one I wrote for SE  
Today :) )  
Everything is a little slow, but I've been tuning it to fix this...I think  
we may just get this one finished on time  



DAI Project: my breakthrough yesterday (figured out how to use [jar](http://java.stanford.com))  
made things move along at a much steadier pace...I'm about to start implement  
the part of the project that I'm expanding on (more to follow when I have  
time)  
got a nice console that takes input from the terminal or a file  
got the initial bid phase completed (on to the offer phase)  
I really hope I finish this on time....gonna have to work all day  
tomorrow on it and only work on SE when absolutely necessary  



On another note, I ran into yowen today who I havn't seen in quite some time.  
I saw her the other day but in passing and we didn't talk (she was on the phone)  



Went to visit Jenn at work later and Meg and Jeff were there hanging out. Jay's  
afterwards and now I am home.  



Oh, and I got mail from Acclaim. My monster.com resume peaked someone's interest  
enough for me to get a "got fill out our job forms" letter. Not much of a bite  
but hey, this is Acclaim. They have a couple of software engineer openings in  
SLC which rocks and maybe something I could do in London which would be most  
excellant. More to follow if anything comes out of this.  



Bed time for me now so I can get up early again tomorrow.
