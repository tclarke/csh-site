While there is still time, I want to wish you all a happy Carl Day!  



Carl Day is a new holiday I just made up. On Carl Day, nobody is allowed to worry about anything...just chill out. The traditional gift given on Carl Day is a pair of comfort insoles. No Carl Day celebration is complete without a goat chase.

<p>Damn, I wish you had told me earlier.  I didn't find out until today and didn't make time to chill out!</p>

<p>That's ok...you didn't know. I give everyone permission to celebrate Carl Day (observed) today.</p>
