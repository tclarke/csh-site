so, I'm trying to change the brake pads on the car cause one of them gotten eaten up by the busted caliper. I jump start the truck (been meaning to do that) to make room in the garage and left it running in the driveway to charge the battery. Realized I don't have a lug wrench that fits the car. (used kim's when I got a flat and had to change it)...can't get the tire off. Went to move the truck back to drive over to tim's and see if they had a wrench and the truck stalls...can't start it (battery's not charged yet) and it's now blocking the car in the driveway.
