I was in the SLC at RIT this saturday practicing for a kung fu demo. I had my CDs so I could listen in the labs after. I was downstairs by the main staircase and I put them (and the rest of my stuff) on the ping pong table. Then, moved them to a couch. I must have not picked them up with the rest of my stuff because I realised about a half hour later that I no longer had them. Multiple calls to campus safety and the SLC cage lost and found yielded nothing. I have lost ALL my cds (except the one that was in my car at the time). I'm really upset because there was a significant investment there and some of that stuff will be really difficult to replace. UGH!!!  



If anyone has any leads, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tell me. I'm offering a reward for their safe return. There were about 40 cds in a black fabric zipper case. There was a section in the back with some techno/electronic and goth stuff and a section in the front with 80s and metal. There was some classical interspersed.
