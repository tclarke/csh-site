I havn't kept up with phyber for quite a while now except the occasional lj comment. The last couple of days we've both been sick and avoiding real work so we got to chatting. She's one of my favorite people to bs with, used to do it all the time on IRC. Feels good to rekindle old friendships; maybe it's time to go through my address books and send off some emails and letters.
