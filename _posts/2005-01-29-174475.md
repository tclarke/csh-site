It's been quite for a while since a post so here's a quick icmp echo_reply. I've been busy at work but that's about it. Went to Fusion last night with jenn and met some new ppl (hi giselc and tekmagika). A good time was had by all.  



I'm currently working on some Python COM stuff with the goal of writing an Exodus plugin in Python. That's about all....not much exciting happening.  



Oh, BTW, finally got around to adding pickled_cotton. Let's hope you make the cut and stay around. (j/k :-P)
