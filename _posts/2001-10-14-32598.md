I went down to the canal and shot a roll of film. I parked near [gillybean](http://www.livejournal.com/users/gillybean/)'s house so I briefly visited her. It was fun and her cat is a cuttie (he's getting big too) :) Went out for Etheopian food last night. The food was good but the service was slow so we missed the [Apocalypse Now Redux](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0078788) at the little. Instead we saw [Pane e tulipani](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0237539), a cute Italian romantic comedy. The acting was quite good, direction was good, story was a little shallow but not too bad. Worth seeing if you are looking for something to do one night.
