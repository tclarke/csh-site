I talked to my dad today. They had to put down Onyx (my dad's german shepard, coon hound mix) this morning. He's been having trouble walking, going to the bathroom in the house, and was having kidney problems. I wish he held out for another month so that I could have seen him again...it's been over a year since I've been there. I wasn't around when my cat died either, I hope this isn't a trend.
