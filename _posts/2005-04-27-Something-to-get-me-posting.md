I think I'll take a cue from pisceskitty. When I get a moment (I'll try and do one every day or two) I'll make a post explaining a little about one of the people on my friend's list. How did we meet, why are we friends, etc. I'll also post some questions for that person to answer (which they should do as a comment for all to see). Not everyone on my friends list will get an entry....either I don't know you well enough yet to write something, or you may not have me on their friends list (tho most of these ppl just don't check/write in their lj's). Don't feel bad if you don't make the list....just chat with me some more and you'll get on there later. I'll be going alphabetically.
