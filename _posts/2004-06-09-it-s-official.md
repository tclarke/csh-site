I've sent back my acceptance letter for the job with one minor modification. My start date is now June 21, 2004....so come visit me before that!! I submitted an application for a town house without seeing it and only talking briefly with the landlord but it sounds like a nice place...perfect for our current situation. I'd have to come up with the deposit and first months rent tho...perhaps I can borrow it for a month until my moving expenses show up in my paycheck.Â  Finally, I may have found a kwoon. There's a tien shan pai school in Dayton which is a northern style not derivied from shaolin but the school incorporates other styles which are. It sounds like a more traditional school with emphasis on external and internal as well as school history, etc....much like my current school. I'll go check it out when I move.
