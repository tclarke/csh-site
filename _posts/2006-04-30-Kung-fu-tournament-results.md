I won first place in my division for open hand forms. Everyone said my form was spot on and looked great. I was happy because I won with a kung fu form and all karate judges. (they tend to look more for power and precision and less for flow)  



Only came in forth for sparring because I hyper-extended my knee during the first bout. It hurt a lot but I managed to finish my fights.  



Skipped the tai chi forms since they were last and I knew I couldn't do tai chi with my injured knee.  



Today, I'm feeling much better. The knee still hurts when I fully extend or close it but the rest of the time it's just a little sore. Should be completed healed in a couple of days.  



Had grilled asparagus and tofu with a caprese salad last night and a fruit salad for desert. The leftover asparagus and some of the mozarella went into an omlette this morning. Mmm.  



Need to clean the house today. I'm not sure what I'll do tonight since Jenn has to work. Any ideas?
