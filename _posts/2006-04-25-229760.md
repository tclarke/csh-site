Ok, head over to [BLOGZOT 2.0 on MacZOT.com](http://maczot.com/). Everytime a blog entry is posted about this, $0.05 is taken off the price of [SubEthaEdit from CodingMonkeys](http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/) until it's free. It's a neat collaborative line editing program. Help out today! MacZOT and TheCodingMonkeys will award $105,000 in Mac software!
