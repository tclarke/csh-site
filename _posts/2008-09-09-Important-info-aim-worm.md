There seems to be a worm running around AIM. I just logged into AIM Express and got bit...I haven't tracked down the details but it may be an Express only problem. If you see a message from anyone with a link to new pictures, avoid it, avoid AIM Express, and change you AIM password. It seems benign, just sends out the same message to your buddy list but it could be harvesting passwords.

<p>I use iChat on a Mac. Should I be worried?</p>

<p>Be careful anyway...I normally use a jabber gateway and happened to hit aim express but I still received a copy of the problem message via jabber but I would have had to click the link. If you see a weird image link show up from a buddy, avoid clicking it.</p>
