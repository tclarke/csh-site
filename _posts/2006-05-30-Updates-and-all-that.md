First off, time to catch up on birthday wishes. Happy b-day to Amber (even tho I already left a message on saturday), Meg (missed yours due to the long crazy weekend), and Mimi (even though you probably don't read LJ anymore).  



Friday I was at the restaurant doing more prep work for the weekend. In the middle of the night, the phone rang and woke us up. Figured it was a wrong number or something cause the cell's didn't ring after so we ignored it. Turns out it was my parents..their barn burned down. Complete loss...including two antique pony traps and the barn itself (over 200 years old with solid oak 6x6 beams hewn from the property). At least it didn't spread to the forest behind the barn. Not sure the cause...there was some old hay in the loft that tends to make lots of fine dust so that could have gone up but it's been that way for years with no problems. It's also possible that one of the new neighbors didn't like looking at it and set a fire (the fire dept said it didn't look like there was a single point of ignition but hasn't released an official report yet).  



Saturday, I was up later than planned due to the 4am wake up call. I went and helped in the kitchen a bit then picked up the cargo van and hot box for the cinci catering job. Loaded it up then loaded the truck for the yellow springs job. Jenn and I went to yellow springs and set up for a smallish wedding there (140 or so). That went quite well and the food was well received. We went back to the restaurant and unlaoded. Jenn got the rest of the night off so we went to Therapy for a couple of glasses of wine and some live jazz. Home somewhat early (11:00 maybe) and off to bed.  



Sunday I was up at 5 to get ready for the cinci job (part 2...the restaurant catered dinner sat night, lunch sunday, cocktail hors deurves and dinner on sunday). Loaded the van and arrived at the Hilton a few minutes after 8. We unloaded and started preparing lunch. Lunch wen out and we sat down to take 5. Things happened a little quicker than we planned. 450 people pushing through 4 doubled sided buffet lines will decimate a lot of food in a little time. We figured we had a half hour until we were through our backups but the idli and vada were gone in less than 15 minutes. Both of these items take a while to make. We managed to speed up the idli production by steaming them in these big pressure steamers that the kitchen had. The vada were another matter...they are fried and the double frier was down to one side due to a bad thermostat. The servers also did not control the rate that the quests were admitted to the buffet...they just opened the lines and let eveybody go. There were conflicting reports as to what was needed so we spent too much time on those two items and everything else went empty. All in all, a lot of small mistakes led to a lunch time disaster of sorts. Talking to the clients later, it was less of an issue...everyone ate and was happy with the food. The wait staff over accentuated the gravity of the situation (as would be appropriate to get things moving) and any diners that complained probably forgot about it once they had food in their stomachs. Dinner went slightly more smoothly. We had enough food cooked and in the hot boxes for the whole meal. The problem was getting the backups to the servers. We filled all the service trays and put additional backups in large baking trays. We had to get the empty service trays, wash them, and fill them from the large trays. The kitchen and banquet room are on different floors with a slow elevator and a hallway in between. I ended up running food and empty trays back and forth a lot. The chicken tikka masala was completely gone at one point but the service trays had a lot of sauce and no chicken. We had good chicken in the cooler without sauce so we warmed that up and mixed it into the remaining sauce for the last three or so trays that were needed. After packing up and all that we got to the restaurant at about 12:30. The owners were there waiting to help unload. They had some dinner and beer waiting so we celebrated (low key since we were all exhausted) for a while then went home to sleep.  



Woke up monday at about 11. Got out of bed at 11:30. Returned the hot box (which they weren't expecting until tuesday). Went to DLM and got some food for dinner then stopped for ice cream before returning the van. Later, we went for a walk in the woods at Antioch. Dinner was tabouli with shrimp, scallop, and veggie kebabs. Yum. Went to sleep early and now I'm back at work.  



Oh, and OMG! Yesterday I saw a boat for sale that I want. It's a small (10' or so) sailboat with a trailer for $800!!! It needs a new rudder and some repair on the forward bulkhead (there's some exposed foam so it need some fiberglass patching). I need new tires for the trunk. My birthday is thursday. The boat is on Beaver Valley rd. if anyone wants to buy it for me.
