I went to Boston yesterday. Stopped at MIT to get grad school info and was denied a tour of the Media Lab ("I can't let you look around because this is a closed building."); oh well. Hung around Hovid Yod for a few hours then went to the only "authentic Moroccan" restaurant in Mass. It was VERY yummy (561 Cambridge St. if anyone is intersted).  



Caught the green line to the theatre district and headed to the club for the concert. One $5.25 bottle of Sam Adams and a 1/2 hour later, the opening band went on. Not great but not bad either. A decent local band. Some more waiting and Icon of Coil went on. The vocals were ok and the performance was mostly canned loops but the production was very good. Not a wonderful live band but they still make good music.  



At about 10:00 VNV Nation came on. They were excellant. Got the small cround riled up and just about everyone was dancing. They played a good mix of old and new songs in a well laed out 90 minute set. They had videos running for all the songs and a good light show. Dark Angel (my fav by them) had a stunning light show.  



I'm off to the store to get Thanksgiving dinner ingredients and I'll prob stop by my aunt's to say hello. Hope everyone has a great weekend.
