fishslayer and Tim played the allies for the first game and Sid and I played the Axis. This was a short game. The allies made some really good defense rolls that wiped out Germany's main forces by turn 2. Japan made one silly mistake that cost it it's navy but due to the lucky rolls in Europe, this made no real difference. So, the Axis surrendered and we began another game.  



Game 2: Brian and Tim as the Axis and myself (-sid) as the allies. This is one of the strangest games I've ever seem. Everyone is rolling average->poor so strategy makes a big difference. There are almost no pieces on the board (germany has < 10 armor units and only three infantry (all infantry are in africa). The US just put a production facility in Finland/Norway and is moving transports to the UK and Africa. The UK has a good airforce and about 10 ground units (mixed). Russia is pushing to Germany while desperately trying to fend off the Japanese who have two production facilies in south Asia. They hold all of Asia except for central USSR and they have Australia. They have a weak navy (the US saw to that) but they are planting six armor in Asia each year.  



We havn't finished yet because we really want to see how this comes out. My thoughts: If Germany can hold off the 3-pronged assault (US and UK landing in France and USSR taking back Poland) for another couple of years, then Japan will walk into Russia. If Germany can not keep up with the onslaught then the US, USSR or the UK (all equally likely) will take Germany for a win. I think the Axis will win but it's still very close so it's hard to say  



fishslayer took a digital pic of the board so we can set it up again to finish the game. Maybe he will post it to LJ (along with the IP holdings).
