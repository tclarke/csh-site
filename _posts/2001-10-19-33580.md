I was up from 4:00am-6:30am coughing last night. At least I got to sleep in to make up for it. [Rachel](http://www.livejournal.com/users/fuzzybunny/) finally got some computer access again and posted to her journal. I should drop her an email now. My mom is here for the weekend so I gotta go do stuff.
