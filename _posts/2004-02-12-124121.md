Got a real interesting spam message today. I've attached a screenshot of it (behind a cut).  



![](http://www.csh.rit.edu/~retrev/livejournal/2004-02-12/paypal.jpg)   
There's some amusing text there, esp. in the right box. Notice the link in the status bar. This is Firefox's sanitized version, the actual link is [http://www.paypal.com%35webscr&amp;cmd%3D_Account_Verification@%32%31%31.%34%32.%31%35%35.%37:37/%70%61%79%70%61%6C.%68%74%6D](http:///) Wonder how many people will fall prey to this one?


<div id="comments"><h4>Comments:</h4><div class="lj-comments"><ul>
<li><h3>riffraff: </h3>
<a id="comment-190"></a>
<p>proportional to the number of people that fell prey to the "mydoom" virus i'd guess...<br>
<br>
"ooh, a calculator attachment!  i've been looking for a calculator program... let me download and run that perfectly innocuous piece of software from a person i don't know..."</p>
</li>
</ul></div></div>
