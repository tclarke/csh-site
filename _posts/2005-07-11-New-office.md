Last week my group moved to our new office area. It's a separate lab area with offices and a large communal area with whilte boards, a conference table, etc. We have our own fridge and microwave and the whole group is in the same area. I'm sharing an office with two other people but it is a large office and has the most window space off all. (it's a corner office) Here's a pic of it. My desk is off to the left side.
