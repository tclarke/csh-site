IIt's been a long week...lots going on at work...  



Anyway, I'm planning on making some beer this weekend, possibly tonight or sunday. If anyone wants to stop over and help, let me know. Here's the recipe I'm trying out.



  * 2.0lb American 6-row  



  * 1.5lb American Wheat  



  * 0.5lb Flaked oats  



  * 3.0lb Light Malt Extract  



  * 1.0lb Honey  



  * 0.25oz Cascade for 60 minutes  



  * 0.75oz Cascade for 30 minutes  



  * 0.50oz Mt. Hood for 30 minutes  



  * 0.50oz Mt. Hood for 15 minutes  



  * American wheat yeast (white labs WLP320)  



Partial mash the grains for 30-45 minutes at 160-170°F. Boil 60 minutes adding hops according to schedule. After boil add LME and honey to sanitize while cooling. Pitch yeast in temp range (68°-72°F for WLP320). Primary ferment until slowed. Secondary ferment for up to a week longer. Bottle with 4.5oz corn sugar.
