I've put some more pictures [here](http://www.notcows.com/gallery/trevor_misc). Also behind the cuts.  



Here's our new bed canopy courtesy of Mr and Mrs ![](http://www.notcows.com/albums/trevor_misc/photo_0061_edited_1.jpg) Naked Barbie cult? Future serial killer? No, it's the local thrift store.

A rather true-to-life toy. It's the Power Team Elite: Army Life toy. Notice the masturbation of the gun.  
![](http://www.notcows.com/albums/trevor_misc/photo_0062_edited_1.jpg) The one picture from elementalamber 's mini-hoot. It's not great because the lighting was poor.  
![](http://www.notcows.com/albums/trevor_misc/photo_0065_edited_1.jpg) Here's some bread I made. Jenn wanted a pic of it.

<p>Now, please explain to me, why would you do that to a cat?</p>

<p>The cat likes to spend time outside but it is getting quite cold. We saw the sweater and figured it would be a good idea if she took a shine to it. Turns out she plopped to the ground and wouldn't move until we took it off.</p>

<p>Your bed is so pretty!<br>

As is the bread.  And the cat is cute too.  And is that the thrift store on Woodman, across from Value City?</p>
