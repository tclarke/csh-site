Update....I upgraded my JDK and rebooted. Now Win2k hangs (inf loop looking thing) on the "Preparing Network Connections" dialog. I've been needing a new drive so I bought a 160gb WD drive for $60 (after mail in rebate), downloaded my copy of XP from the MSDNAA and installed in. I'm running XP. Things are getting bad again tho. Looks like the stripe (on a highpoint) is showing up broken so I can't access my old drive....hope I don't lose everything.
