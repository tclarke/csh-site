I just got back from Vertex. Two clubbing nights in a row and I'm tired. Last night was the final Vertex on the road and today was the opening party at Vertex 2.0. It's now in the old freakazoid building and they did a great job renovating. Time to fight the two cups of coffee I just put in my system and go to sleep.
