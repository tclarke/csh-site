Today's solar eclipse is a hybrid. I.E. most places that see it will see a partial eclipse. A very small strip of the south Pacific ocean will see a total eclipse for a short time. The duration is estimated to be about 42 seconds. In a couple of weeks The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy movie opens. Coincidence? Or vogons?
