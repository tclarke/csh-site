The past week has been busy so I havn't posted much....with that, time to start my posts again. Today I'll talk about cazarella.  



I met Heather through Kim. Soon after meeting her, the two of them moved into the house I was renting. It was a bit of a diffiacult decision as I knew her for only a very short time but it turned out to be a good decision. Heather is a very no-nonsense kind of person. She knows what she wants in life and goes after it. Regardless of what's going on with her, she'll drop it to comfort a friend in need. It's not surprising that someone who loves animals as much as she does cares just as much for her fellow humans.  



Time for questions.



  1. How are you doing? It's been a while.
  2. When did you decide to pursue an animal related career?
  3. Which pet is your favorite?
  4. Do you plan on staying in Lima for a while? Or would you like to move elsewhere?
  5. Do you still get stuck mowing the lawn down in Nunda?
