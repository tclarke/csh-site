So, I'm thinking about going skiing sunday night (5:00-9:30ish) at Mad River Mountain. Anyone interested? $21 ticket, $29 if you need rentals.

<p>Well..we are planning on leaving Dayton about 3:30 or 4:00...Jenn has never been skiing and hasn't decided precisely what she'll do but I'll probably give her a quick lesson and if she likes it, she'll either sign up for a group lesson (if they have them sunday night) or poke around the bunny slope. I plan on skiing the bigger stuff (haha...I know...bigger stuff...ohio...funny) for at least part of the night. Let me know if you want to go...I'll check lj and email at least on sunday morning and I'm pretty sure you've got our phone numbers so you can always call.</p>
