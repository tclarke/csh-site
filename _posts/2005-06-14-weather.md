Another severe t-storm watch for my area. That's the fourth in the last week and a half. Hmm.

<p>we had one every day at the same time in the afternoon for almost a week straight. <br>

it was nice because it would get soooo hot, then the storms would cool everything down and water my outside plants for me.</p>

</ul></div></div>
