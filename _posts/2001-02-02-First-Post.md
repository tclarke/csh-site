I'm not really sure why I titled this entry "first post" cause I really hate those losers who have nothing better to do than constantly hit reload waiting for a new article to appear on their favorite news site (usually [/.](http://slashdot.org)) Oh well, guess I'm fealing a little cynical today, but what's new? I figure I'd give a brief description of myself since this is my first entry, but you all are probably industrious and can find out more about me than I can think about right now. Maybe you could ICQ or email me. I probably won't respond since I'm pretty anti-social and loath a good portion of the human race, but maybe you'll be lucky.  



I'm felling kinda tired right now; I just got out of a particularly boring discrete math class and I'm ready to go home (almost time). I'm gonna end this entry now. Maybe I'll post something useful later tonight.
