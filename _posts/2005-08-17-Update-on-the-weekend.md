_Thursday_ Thursday, we were a little behind schedule but not too bad. On the way to the airport a huge storm cell came through which resulted in a couple of inches of water on the roads and low visibility. We got to the airport about 20 minutes before the flight was scheduled to take off. Not to worry, everything is delayed because of the storms so we had a little over an hour. We sat down and had a nice snack/dinner. A short while later, they cancelled our flight to cinci. I waited in line to reschedule. They were able to put us on the next (and last for the day) flight to cinci with just enough time to catch the last flight to Boston. That flight was about 9:30 (our original was at 6:30 and it is now 7:30). More snacking and beveraging. We get on the new flight ok and arrive in Boston at 12:55 in the am. Originally we were scheduled to arrive just before 11 which would give us just enough time to catch the 11:30 bus to Providence. That is the last bus. The last commuter train is about 12 and the last subway is at 1. This meant my parents had to drive up to Logan to get us. Not an easy proposition given the state of construction up there. We arrived in Lincoln at about 2:30 then went to sleep.  



_Friday_ We slept in a little bit on friday. Then off to Shanna's for breakfast. Most of the remainder of the day was spent looking at places to hold the reception. We settled on Chan's egg rolls, jazz, and blues. Some additional errands were run, etc. but it was a reasonably uneventful day. Dinner was fish and chips from Ye Olde. MMMM!  



_Saturday_ We went to Kennedy's for breakfast with my mom, grandparents, cousin seth, little Liam, and my grandfather's brother Herbert (who was in town for the wedding). We went to visit Jenn's dad who was doing quite well. A gift was purchased at the mall and we decided to go to Chan's for dinner (this was before we finalized the decision to have the reception there but we were pretty sure). It was yummy.  



_Sunday_ Sunday was the wedding. The ceremony was at 2 and it was nice although the temperature was in the 90s and it was near 100% humidity. Ugh. The reception was at 5 in Bristol. There was a bit of a breeze off the water so things were a little more bearable but it was still hot and muggy. The reception was at a historic mansion in Bristol and was quite extravagent. The food was wonderful and I got to see many people I have not seen in many years. We left about 9:30 and I was sleeping by 11:30. Around then I was awakened by a huge thunderstorm. It was probably due to the hurricane off short and the rain was really coming down. Turns out there was another storm in the southern part of the state but there was a strip of calm right over Bristol so they never even knew that it rained.  



_Monday_ Breakfast at home today; blueberry pancakes. Much of the day was spent relaxing. We drove up to Braintree to the bakery we are getting our cake. The cake is ordered, etc. Got some super tasty ice cream on the way back. Monday night, we went to tealuxe. This is where Jenn started to freak out a bit because of rumors of Delta filling for bankruptcy and not honoring tickets. (Turns out it was just ASA but we didn't know that at the time). She was originally staying until next monday to continue wedding planning and go to a family reunion. She wasn't too into the reunion and most of the planning that needed doing is now done so she decided to change her flight. $50 later she's not on my flight as the first leg was full but she is on a later flight through Atlanta.  



_Tuesday_ Breakfast at Frank's. After my dad drove me up t Quincy to catch the T and Jenn went to Christmas Tree with my mom to return some items (and apparently purchase some more). I arrived at the airport at about 11:30 for a flight that left about 1. I got checked in and had a snack. There were quite a few people on standby on my flight so it would not have helped to put Jenn on standby. That flight was about 15 minutes late because it had to reroute over Syracuse and Cleveland due to weather further south. Yes folks, this is an omen. I had nearly 2 hours to kill in cinci. Jenn was supposed to take off soon so I called her. She was delayed for a long time on the runway (an our and a half) because that bad weather that diverted me was apparently a large t-storm that shut down the entire Washington center airspace. In case you are not familiar with airspace centers on the east coast, south of Boston is New York which is a geographically small center covering the airspace over NYC and the surrounding area. Next south is Washington wich covers most of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, part of Pennsylvania and part of West Virginia. West of New York and the northern bit of Washjngton is Cleveland center. Basically, Washington center is most of the central east coast. Jenn was finally diverted over Syracuse and eastern Ohio (no parachute...I thought of that). She landed in Atlanta and sat on the ground waiting for a jetway for over an hour. She was late for her connecting flight but it was cancelled anyway. Checking with the Delta rep, there were no more flights she could take into Dayton, Cincinnati, or Columbus that night. They gave her a $7 food voucher and a discount at the Ramada. She barely had enough money with her to book a room (I havn't checked yet but she may have been short with the tax and they were nice enough to cover the extra couple of dollars). There was sleeping.  



_Wednesday_ Jenn is still in Atlanta and has been sending me picture updates with her phone. She received a [wake up call](http://www.notcows.com/gallery/August_05_Trip/morning1) this morning. Her flight leaves about 12:30 and gets in to Dayton a little after 2 when we will be reunited.  



And scene.  



EDIT: There are some more pics (including the ones that Jenn msg'd me) [here](http://www.notcows.com/gallery/August_05_Trip).
