<li class=subject><h3>phyber: my answers (part 1)</h3>
<a id="comment-857"></a>
<p><b>1) Are you currently in a serious relationship?</b>
Yes. I have been married a little over one year.<br>
<br>
<b>2) What was your dream growing up?</b>
I had several, but the one that was consistent throughout most of my life was that I always wanted to live in California. I was completely obsessed with this idea since my first trip there when I was 7 years old.<br>
<br>
<b>3) What talent do you wish you had?</b>
To be able to study any foreign language and pick it up very quickly and then keep the knowledge once I've learned it.<br>
<br>
<b>4) If I bought you a drink what would it be?</b>
Most likely just a coke. If I was in the mood for something alcoholic, Kahlua &amp; cream.<br>
<br>
<b>5) Favorite vegetable?</b>
Probably yams. I really like them cut up and cooked in brown sugar and butter.<br>
<br>
<b>6) What was the last book you read?</b>
I have recently purchased a book on the foreclosure process because we are considering getting involved in real estate investing, so I'm in the process of reading that.<br>
<br>
<b>7) What zodiac sign are you?</b>
Virgo.<br>
<br>
<b>8) Any Tattoos and/or Piercings? Explain where.</b>
Yeah, I have three tattoos. I got a small one on my right thigh when I was 15 of a flaming heart. Then I have a large gargoyle-looking dude on my right shoulderblade that I got when I was 18. My most recent one is of the symbol used to represent a router on the outside of my right ankle that I got when I was 25. As for piercings, I have two holes in my right ear and three in my left. A long time ago, I had my navel pierced, but I let that close.<br>
<br>
<b>9) Worst Habit?</b>
I tend to procrastinate in doing things that I have to do but don't necessarily want to. I know that procrastinating doesn't make it go away, it just prolongs the issue, so I don't know why I do it. But I do.<br>
<br>
<b>10) If you saw me walking down the street would you offer me a ride?</b>
Of course.<br>
<br>
<b>11) What is your favorite sport?</b>
If it's considered a sport, fishing. Otherwise, volleyball or bowling would be ones that I like to participate in. As far as my favorite sport to watch, I'd say college basketball.<br>
<br>
<b>12) Do you have a Negative or Optimistic attitude?</b>
Both, depending on the situation. At work, I'm pretty negative. In general, I try to be more optimistic.<br>
<br>
<b>13) What would you do if you were stuck in an elevator with me?</b>
Initially, probably freak out a bit because the thought of being trapped in an elevator at all is pretty scary.<br>
<br>
<b>14) Worst thing to ever happen to you?</b>
I was raped while I was on vacation in January of 1995. While today I believe this event made me stronger in some ways, I am disappointed in my reaction at the time. I am Catholic and always believed in not having sex prior to being married. This event obviously made it impossible to adhere to that belief. My attitude after the rape was "well, it doesn't matter anymore" and then I had made several bad choices and I did in fact have sexual relations in one way or another with several men. These mistakes haunt me now, quite often.<br>
<br>
<b>15) Tell me one weird fact about you.</b>
I know most of the stupid area codes in the US and Canada.<br>
<br>
<b>16) Do you have any pets?</b>
Yes, four cats! Layla, Cisco, Juniper, and Rookie.<br>
<br>
<b>17) What if I showed up at your house unexpectedly?</b>
Come on in.<br>
<br>
<b>18) What was your first impression of me?</b>
I don't remember exactly because it was so long ago (hey, I'm getting old), but I know it was a positive one.<br>
<br>
<b>19) Do you think clowns are cute or scary?</b>
Definitely scary.<br>
<br>
<b>20) If you could change one thing about how you look, what would it be?</b>
I hate the fact that I am bow legged!<br>
<br>
<b>21) Would you be my crime partner or my conscience?</b>
It depends on the crime. If it involved stealing street signs, I'd be right there with you.<br>
<br>
<b>22) What color eyes do you have?</b>
They're kind of multi colored. They are dark brown around the pupil, then they are green around that, and then grey around that.</p>

<br>

Can.<br>
<br>
<b>25) If you won $10,000 today, what would you do with it?</b>
First, put away about $3,000 of it to cover capital gains tax.  Then, probably something boring, like pay off a loan or put it towards a new roof.<br>
<br>
<b>26) Warm or cool colors?</b>
Probably cool colors.<br>
<br>
<b>27) What's your favorite place to hang at?</b>
Bass Pro!<br>
<br>
