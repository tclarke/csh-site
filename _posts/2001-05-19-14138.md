Just got back from [Brian's](http://www.livejournal.com/users/fishslayer) party. A good time was had by all. Lots of people were there. I got a chance to chat with some folks I havn't really seem in a while. [Rachel](http://www.livejournal.com/users/fuzzybunny) ended up going white water rafting for the weekend. Hope she has a good time. I'm gonna check my mail, ready a few pages of a book them go to sleep.
