If others in the country are like me hen whomever did this has already failed. The point of terrorism is to strike fear into the public. I am not afraid. I am watching this with silent detachment. Regardless of how it is presented, those pictures on the little box are not real and will never be real. I am truly sorry for the victims and I am angry at the perpetrators, but I am not terrorized.
