I woke up this morning with an intense fight or flight feeling. The adrenaline didn't want to subside; not sure why. Kinda freeked me out. Might have had something to do with a dream I was having but I don't remember most of it so I'm not sure. All I remember is that someone, possibly me, had very short hair, just long enough to hold hair dye. He/me had their head dyed to look like a yin yang. Wierd. BTW, if I ever shave my head, I think I'll dye it that way...it's kinda neat.
