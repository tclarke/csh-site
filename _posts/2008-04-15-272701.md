Dear diary blog,  
Today I officially became a tech lead for my group. I say a tech lead instead of the tech lead because we are trying something a little different. In an attempt to lower the tech lead's workload, the job's duties are being split between two people. A coworker will be handling the day to day management stuff (assignment of code reviews, keeping the bug tracker up to date, approval of bug fix solutions, etc.) and I'll be handling the customer interfacing and broader design decisions. I'll be the one giving demos and turning user "requirements" into real requirements and approving requirement designs. Not sure what the new job titles will be...probably Technical Manager, and Lead Architect or something along those lines. I still need to file my taxes..I've been putting them off. I've got them all filled out and I'm filing electronically so I just need to hit the submit button when I get home. Anyway,  
Blogs and kisses
