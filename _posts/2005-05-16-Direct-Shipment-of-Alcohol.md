It seems that in New York and Michigan, the laws that disallowed direct shipment of wine from out-of-state sources have been struck down as a violation of free-commerce laws. Basically, you could get wine shipped directly to you (via internet ordering for example) from an in-state winery, but out-of-state wines had to use a state licensed wholesaler to import. These regulations are supposedly there to prevent minors from obtaining alcohol through the mail where ID checks are difficult or impossible. It's been ruled, however, that this gives an unfair advantage to in-state wineries.  



There are many other states (OH included) who have been waiting on this decision (there is a pending supreme court case that was put on hold pending the New York/Michigan decisions) to determine if their (similar) laws are valid. It appears that they will most likely be ruled unconstitutional as well. This is especially good in OH as imported wines have a mandatory 33.3% markup (tariff) placed on them. This will cause most wine prices to drop significantly (hopefully), but more importantly, I'll be able to direct order wines from my favorite NY wineries.  



Thanks to thetick23 for the info.

<p>This decision is only going to have a "real" impact if shipping companies will now handle these kinds of shipments. I know Schu was saying that UPS won't take them because of the risk of breakage. Need to ask him if their policies are going to change now.</p>

<p>Terroists don't use wine so the USPS will probably ship. :)</p>
