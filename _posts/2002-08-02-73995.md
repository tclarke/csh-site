Back from my trip. It was fun. The [boat](http://furyo.dcostin.dyndns.org/) was huge. Went from Jamestown, RI originally to Martha's Vineyard but we diverted to Hyannis at the last minute. Jenn's aunt lives on the cape so we crashed at her house for the night. I got to drive her Mustang convertable for the night...hehe. Anyway, back to RI the next day for dinner at Ye Olde Fish'n'Chips (MMMMMMM!!!!) and a quick round of golf at my grandfather's house then back to Rochester. I'll post pics a little later, I'm gonna take some at the North vs. South BBQ tonight and copy all the pics over at once.
