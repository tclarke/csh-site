I just noticed the icon at the bottom of an aim window when you direct connect. I'll cut it so I don't mess up your friend's list.  



![](http://www.csh.rit.edu/~retrev/livejournal/2004-01-28/aim-shot1.jpg) It seems to be two aol guys approaching each other at high speed. The arrow apparently indicates the point of initial impact. Hmmm...

<p>what appears to be a "double-headed arrow" is actually a discus.  the aol buddy on the left is hurling the discus (think "discs of tron") at the aol buddy on the right.  <br>
<br>
the aol buddy on the right will attempt to catch it, but it will fly wild and cut off the right arm of the drowning aol buddy above the "add buddy" text (why does it say "add buddy"?  because he really needs a friend right about now).<br>
<br>
the aol buddy above "talk" is actually projectile vomiting at the fake id card to his right.<br>
<br>
apparently the aol buddy above "block" has had his left arm removed by the LASER CIRCLE AND LINE OF DOOM.  he is about to have his right arm chopped off as well.<br>
<br>
the aol buddy above "send" is attempting to deliver the Publisher's Clearing House winning check in a blizzard.</p>

I'm with you until here. That's not snow, it's a jpeg artifact.</p>
