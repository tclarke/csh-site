My car is broken. Clutch won't disengage so I had to go to work synchro shiting. Went to Joe's even tho there isn't a mechanic on the weekends. Joe was there working on his truck and gave me five minutes of his time for a chat. He says it's probably the clutch hydrolics system. Most likly a bad slave cylinder, about $60-$70. Less likely it's the master cylinder, $200ish. Slight chance it's the clutch then I'm screwed, $600+. Since I lost a lot of clutch fluid not just a 1/4 inch or so and because the car is relatively new, he doesn't think it's the clutch. Gotta bring it in monday to get it checked out.  



Jenn can't work tonight now cause she doesn't have a car. That's like $50 she'll be down. Can't work tomorrow either. I need to find a ride to work tomorrow morning at 4am (any takers, please). I'm already gonna be short on bills this month, this is the last thing I need. Ugh, I need *hugs*.
