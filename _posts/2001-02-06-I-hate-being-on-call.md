Well, I'm on call at work this week. Our main cluster went down at 5:00 this morning and guess who had to fix it? Well, at least I had some help from Mike. Some damn spammer fux0rd our mailer and that may have caused two of the machines to hang. GRRR!! Everything is working now so I can get a bit of rest maybe.
