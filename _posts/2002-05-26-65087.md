$80 and 45 minutes later, I officially have an infected leg...prob an insect bite or something started it. I was driving around rochester looking for an open pharmacy and began to think. I pay them my money (not much considering), get some antibiotics, and a week and a half later, I'm fine. It took a while for me to remember I have a potentially serious infection. Not too long ago, this probably would have killed me or at least resulted in a lost leg. Hmm....makes you think how good modern medicine is (even with all its failings).
