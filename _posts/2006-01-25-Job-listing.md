Ok, my company is looking for a Softeare Engineer II in Chantilly, VA. (very close to Dulles airport) There is some information at <http://www.ballaerospace.com> under Careers, or you can contact me and I'll get some more information. It's on out "most wanted" list of positions so there is a big referal bonus which I'll split with someone if they decide to apply (and get the job obviously). :)Â  Let me know if you are interested.
