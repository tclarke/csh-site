I believe that klutzywaitress and I have brought a little of Rochester with us. It's currently snowing like a bugger and this storm is supposed to drop half of Dayton's average annual snowfall by tomorrow afternoon. I'm still at work even thought Dayton Ops second in command just came around nearly ordering everyone to leave. I'm going to build the new code baseline, clean up a few things, then head home.
