How did cats arrive at the notion that knocking things off tables gets them fed? It can't be an instinctual behavior as cats havn't been domesticated long enough for that kind of complex, delayed reward behavior to come about and I find it hard to believe that their wild brethren found that knocking rocks off of larger rocks is somehow benefitial to survival. I don't think that there are cat schools out there that teach this so it's probably not a learned behavior. That leaves only one answer; this must be a behavior independently discovered by many cats over and over.

<p>and did you feed the cat? ;) then it's definitely a learned behavior. try getting a small water bottle and squirting him the next time he knocks something off the table rather than feeding him. I bet he'll learn fast not to do that anymore :)</p>

<p>The cat did get fed but not for some time. (probably 1/2 hour or so) Two problems with the squirt bottle. They don't always work as expected. At least one cat I know learned to run/stop being bad when the bottle came out but was just a annoying when it was not in sight. Two, it was early and use of a squirt bottle had about a 50/50 chance of hitting me in the face instead of the cat. :)</p>

<p>so, all in all, NOT so stupid cat. <br>
<br>
my grandma had a cat the woke her up every morning to be fed, by sitting on her bedside table and breathing his tuna breath into her nostrils. it worked every time ;)</p>

<p>Cats DO have an innate ability to find the most insidiously efficient way of getting what they want.  I also think that they have a very cynical sense of humor.  No wonder they were worshiped by ancient Egyptians, inspired superstitios beliefs in the Chinese and were thought of as withces familiars in Pre-industrial Europe.<br>

They also like to eat bugs...</p>
