In case you didn't know, Serenity opened this weekend. In terms of money made it came in second behind a film showing on 1000 more screens. I've been waiting for it for years and got to see a preview release back in may. I have not yet seen the final release because of the wedding. Yup, I had planned on watching it saturday night but the timing (and $$ situation of some friends) made this a less attractive option than Waterfire. (which was fabulous anyway so no love lost :) ) I plan on seeing Serenity this week sometime. In the meantime [here](http://www.hatrack.com/osc/reviews/everything/2005-09-30-extra.shtml) is a fabulous review from Orson Scott Card. (author of the sci-fi classic Ender's Game, among other things) He has the most fabulous things to say about the movie including "And I'll tell you this right now: If _Ender's Game_ can't be this kind of movie, and this good a movie, then I want it never to be made. I'd rather just watch _Serenity_ again." If you haven't decided if you want to watch Serenity or if you've decided you don't want to watch Serenty, read this review and think again.
