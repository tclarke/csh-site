fsck me this is the best dab I've heard in a while. This is a 2004 album I've not heard before. Rocks my socks off...Highly recommended.  
This is an interesting album with some really popular club tracks which I've been meaning to get. Finally downloaded it. It's reminiscent of LOA. Great vocal house album for you LOA fans. Not for the easily offended tho, as it has some explicit lyrics.  
I skipped the Radio Edit as I was one d/l short this month and I'm not a big fan of that mix anyway. The Subliminal Mix is by far my favorite.
