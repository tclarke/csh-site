Went to Vertex sunday to see a concert. It was pretty good plus I went with [a wonderful person](http://www.livejournal.com/users/klutzywaitress/). I recorded part of the concert (battery problems prevented me from getting the whole thing). I've transfered then to my computer and [Ogg](http://www.vorbis.com) encoded them. You can get the files and some details on the recording at <http://www.csh.rit.edu/~retrev/music.shtml> Info and mp3's from last September's Disintegration with Vespertyne concert is there as well. Enjoy.
