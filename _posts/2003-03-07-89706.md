fishslayer is awesome. He was cleaning out his car and reached into the pouch behind the driver's seat pulling out my long lost sun glasses. Yes, the ones I lost 9 months ago moving him into the house. Now I'm only missing my Cross stylus/pen, [my cd's](http://www.csh.rit.edu/~retrev/lost_cds.html), and my mind. Oh well, [baby steps](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0103241).
