So, did I make it through 15 hours of waiting and watching? I sure did. The extended editions of FOTR and TTT were MUCH better. The story flowed more smoothly and was easier to understand; didn't feel like they ran 3:45. As for ROTK? I liked it. They changed the story more than either of the other two but the changes were necessary for time reasons and for the most part did not detract from the plot. The biggest change was the removal of the final storyline involving Sauruman which is good IMHO since it would have been too much to deal with after the climax of the plot.  



I'm glad I got to see the whole story at once and I will definately be purchasing the super mega mega edition DVD boxed set when it is finally released.
