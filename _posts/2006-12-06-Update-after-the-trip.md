The trip back from Maine went well. It was tiring and we hit some dicey weather in PA...had to stop for a while to let it blow by...tornado warnings and such.  



We finished painting the walls in the bathroom. They look pretty good. Oh, and the front door is a nice red now. Next steps, finish the molding and ceiling in the bathroom, then prime and paint the dining room.  



I finally fixed one of my computers last night. I blew up another power supply...that's right folks, that makes four power supplies in that machine. I scavenged the one from my seldom used ubuntu machine (it's got a crap video card). I also replaced the processor so I'm at 1.1GHz in my windows machine now. I player a little with the latest version of ORBITER last night. I can't wait for Kosmos to make a release...it's an open source ORBITER like program...sounds like they are close to a release.
