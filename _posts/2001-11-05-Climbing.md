So, I entered the Galyan's speed climbing contest for the hell of it (the prelims are free so why not?) I scored what I felt was a respectable time (32.5 sec) but didn't think I'd qualify (the top time was 18.7 sec and the guys I qualified with were mid 20's). Anyway, I get a call and I made it to the top ten. So, if anyone is interested, I'll be climbing at Galyan's (in marketplace mall) this sat, Nov 10 at 1:45ish.
