Thursday Jenn, Amber, and I went to see Walmart: The High Cost of Low Price at the Neon. It was a pretty good documentary and covered the whole range of Walamart evils. One particularly interesting bit was on foreign (particularly) Chinese factories. Most documentaries, etc. mention the poor conditions and give some statistics, but this one actualy interviewed a couple of Chinese workers and showed some hidden camera footage of the factories. Afterwards, there was discussion accompanied by complimentary coffee, beer, and wine.  



Friday, we planned on seeing the new HP movie but due to illness, we postponed. Jenn and I went to the Dublin instead. On the way out, we noticed our neighbor putting up an xmas tree and figured he was probably bored so Jenn went and convinced him (didn't take much) to go with us. Turns out, he was having a rough week and really appreciated a night out which was a bonus. We entered the pub, paid our cover, and then I noticed a steel guitar. Oh no...country band. There was also a banjo so I fiigured maybe it'll be bluegrass, which I can handle. Then, they played Dire Straits, Bob Dylan, and the Indigo Girls all in a row. This gave further support to my assertions that bluegrass is the punk of country. There's very little that can't be covered with a mandolin and banjo. We left after their first set and as we were walking out the mandolin player called me over. I thought he has looked familiar and apparently he recognized me. Turns out his sons are in my kung fu class. Small world...  



Saturday morning was filled with tai chi and kung fu goodness. Jenn and I were both feeling a little crudy in the afternoon. Either we can down with something or the couple of drinks on friday coupled with a morning of exercise made us slightly dehydrated. Anyway, a nap later and we were doing much better.  



Sunday, Jenn had to work so I poked around the house a bit in the morning. I watched some Earth2 while Jenn took an after work nap. We went to the store to get some groceries and made a yummy dinner. I fixed the toilet (the ball cock was broken and making a load vibration-type noise when the valve was open). The sunday night line up was pretty funny and then we went to bed.
