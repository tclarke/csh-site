bits is an intelligent and determined person. He's successful in his career but that's not enough. He's establishing his own company and is terribly excited about the possibilities. Talking to him for ten minutes is enough to convince you that he has that thing that all successful entrepreneurs have. It's a combination of vision, intelligence, and sensabilities. Beyond success in business, bits also has a warm heart. He may not have had the most luck in relationships but he has good intentions and a strong desire to make someone as happy as he'd like to be himself. This same nature influences his relationships with friends and family. You can always count on him for a smile. He's got a way of making you forget your problems.  



On to the questions

  2. What is your ultimate goal in life?  



  3. What's your favorite whiskey?  



  4. Of the places you have lived, which has the best memories?  



  5. What non-computing carreer would you seriously consider pursuing?

<p>Wow...  that's a surprise.  Thanks for the kind words.  <br>
<br>
1. I'm not satisfied with what I was allowed to create at work for our Intranet.  I've got many ideas and a creative potential that is going largely unfulfilled.  I'm definitely on fire lately.  I'm working on an online on-call schedule app that I can sell to generate money for the costs of my startup.  I've also given some modules to laszlosystems.com recently.<br>
<br>
2. Get married and have kids.  I want a whole gaggle.  I can't wait to teach them all the cool things I've learned in my life.  I'm going to be the dad sitting on the floor eating cereal and watching cartoons with my kids on a Saturday morning.  I just met a great woman who wants a bunch of kids.<br>
<br>
3. Cragganmore (12y/o).  It's very smooth. No overpowering aftertaste.  Reasonably priced.<br>
<br>
4. Rochester.  It also has some of the worst memories, but it was the one time when I was surrounded by all of my friends.<br>
<br>
5. Screenwriter.  I've written a couple of pilots and have several screenplays in the works.  I don't know if I'll ever try to sell any, but I do successful friends in the business and a cousin who's an agent...<br></p>
