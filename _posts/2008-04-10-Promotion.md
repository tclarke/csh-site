I've been offered a promotion at work. They want me to be the new tech lead for the project. Unfortunately it's not likely to come with an immediate raise but it only helps when mid-year performance reviews roll around.

<p>I would say it depends on how much project management you would be responsible for.   I recently became tech lead on a project and it didn't go well.  Not because I couldn't get the coding done, but because I couldn't manage other people and meet the unreasonable expectations placed on us.<br>
<br>
Before you accept it, I would negotiate how things would run and outline a structure for how you want to manage the project and make sure everyone is in agreement.</p>
