Ok, with the [announcement](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/google-labs-groups2/browse_thread/thread/7a92653357cbad54/9ae8221d8ad46b65#9ae8221d8ad46b65) of a revised Google Groups, let's play a little geek game. Go to Google Groups and search for your username (or names if applicable) and post a link to the oldest article and if you like, the number of hits returned. I'm mostly interseted in what is actually indexed.  



I'm 170 hits and the oldest is [Mar 24, 1998](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.unix.programmer/browse_thread/thread/4afc4586d7b1622a/58ab8a03a5d8d4a9?q=retrev@csh.rit.edu&_done=%2Fgroups%3Fq%3Dretrev@csh.rit.edu%26start%3D160%26scoring%3Dd%26&_doneTitle=Back+to+Search&&d#58ab8a03a5d8d4a9). I know this is not accurate as I've been posting since 95 at least. How accurate is your search?   



REVISION:  
I revise this....the advenced search has a search by author which returned better results.Â  269 articles (tho sometimes I get 500+....hmm, I'm wondering about that) but the date looks slightly better. [Dec 12 1995](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/sci.virtual-worlds/browse_thread/thread/4ea72f90cf399ee0/ae64714651f8626a?q=author:retrev@csh.rit.edu&_done=%2Fgroups%3Fq%3Dauthor:retrev@csh.rit.edu%26start%3D200%26scoring%3Dd%26num%3D100%26hl%3Den%26ie%3DUTF-8%26safe%3Doff%26filter%3D0%26&_doneTitle=Back+to+Search&&d#ae64714651f8626a)

<p>I got to 1991, and I could probably go back further if I felt like trying harder...<br>
