Court went ok. I thought I was going to have to go back since the DA wasn't there and the judge was mostly doing arraignments. Turns out the DA reviewed my case and left a plea bargain offer with the jedge which I accepted. They dropped charges on the two suspentions (which are the big charges) if took car of everything at the DMV and plead guilty to the speeding and lapse of insurance.  



What does this mean? First, I'm still with out a car for the duration of the suspention which is still long but I expected this. I have a speeding ticket on my license (time for defensive driving course I suppose) and a driving w/o insurance ticket. Finally, I have to pay $200 in fines and court fees. This isn't too bad considering the minimum fine for each of the two dropped charges is $500.

<p>excellent.  as far as the defensive driving course, mail or phone Gary Caton at campus safety at RIT.  he does defensive driving courses every few months.  their effect lasts for 3 years, and they cost about $20 or $30.  i highly recommend it.<br>
<br>
for how long is the suspension?</p>
