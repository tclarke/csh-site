I finally getting some of my work done so I'm feeling pretty productive. It's back down to the point where it's managable.  



I picked up Meg and Jeff from the airport this morning and I'm glad to see them. Gonna go climbing while they are here and we might head out to Piranha one night.  



I'm a little upset my b0x3n isn't up to snuff after I upgraded the operating system (OpenBSD 2.6/2.7/2.8 mishmash to OpenBSD 2.8). mpg123 isn't working properly (even after a re-compile); it plays the first few frames of the file over and over again. I really should compile a custom kernel....that may help. Oh well, when I get time.
