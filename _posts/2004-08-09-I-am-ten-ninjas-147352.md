I always seem to have a problem. I walk up behind people and they never know I'm there. I'm not trying to be particularly stealthy, people just don't realize I'm behind them and inevitably jump through the roof. Sometime I even try to make extra noise to prevent this. Is Kung Fu badness™  ingrained in my being? or do I have no disearnable soul? I'm confused.
