Jenn got us vip tickets to the Kerry town hall rally today. We were slightly to the right of the podium and about 12 feet from it. We were also two rows behind John Glenn. It was a great rally with some good info and a much more relaxed and personable Kerry. The highlight tho...I got to shake hands and talk (briefly) with John and Mrs. Glenn and John Kerry! I spoke to the future president about the Sox. (and how I hope to see two great victories over the next few weeks)
