It's been a rough few days...The Xterra is in the shop again. On Wednesday night we had a problem starting the truck. Thought it was the battery as it sounded like the started didn't have enough juice to turn over the engine and I knew my battery was on its last legs. AAA came out to change the battery and it still wouldn't start. Sounded like the engine was seized. A quick check of the radiator showed that it was empty even though the overflow tank was full. I was quite mad since I'd just had the oil changed and they are supposed to check that sort of thing and there was no sign of a sudden coolant dump. (nothing on the ground...no anti-freeze smell...nothing in the oil) I was getting ready to push for a replacement engine from the shop that did the work.  



I took it in and they looked at it. They were able to get the engine to fire up. It was hydro-locked because the head gaskets failed. Seems like things were looking up slightly. I waited a couple of days for an estimate as they were very busy and I hadn't made an appointment.  



I got the news today. $1700 for the head gasket work without a warentee. That's because there is a chance the crank shaft bearings were wrecked when the engine try to turn over while it was hydro-locked. The guy said he didn't hear any ticking, etc. which would indicate bad bearings but it's always a possibility. If they are bad, it needs a new engine. I could go the safe route and just have a new engine installed just in case. A re-manufactured engine is $6000. He found a used engine with 119k miles on it for $3000.  



Well, this was bad news...do I gamble and risk paying an extra $1700 if I need to replace the engine anyway? After talking to some people I've decided the best course of action is something I've been considering for a while anyway. I'm having them do the head gasket work, then I'll trade the Xterra in for a newer car. I've been avoiding this because I really like my Xterra. It was my first new car and it's treated me very well until recently. (9 months ago when I had to have the transmission rebuilt) I've been entertaining the possibility of getting rid of it since it still has decent trade in value so if I want to get anything for it, the clock is ticking.  



Having resigned myself to this decision, I need to decide what to get. Should I go with a replacement? I.E. something with some cargo room, 4-wheel drive, tow capacity, etc? Should I get something very fuel efficient? Jenn currently has the Acura which is not a roomy car. If I go fuel efficient, I'm thinking about a Yaris. Currently I'm leaning towards something a little less fuel efficient (though more so than the Xterra) with a little more room, etc. I saw a [silver WRX wagon](http://www.cars.com/go/search/detail.jsp;?tracktype=usedcc&searchType=21&pageNumber=0&numResultsPerPage=50&largeNumResultsPerPage=0&sortorder=descending&sortfield=PRICE+descending&certifiedOnly=false&criteria=K-%7CE-%7CM-_45_%7CB-12000%7CN-N%7CR-75%7CI-1%7CP-PRICE+descending%7CQ-descending%7CZ-45405&aff=national&paId=224904948&recnum=1&leadExists=true) for under $12k which caught my eye. Any suggestions or thoughts?

<p>are an good cross between fuel economy and utility.<br>
I just sold my '03, that we replaced with a minivan.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of choices out ther.</p>

<p>A lot of people really like their Saturn VUEs.  I love my Toyota RAV4.  It's a small sport-ute but it gets good gas mileage.<br>
<br>
If you trade in the Xterra, do you know anyone who would let you borrow a SUV-type vehicle if you needed to grab something big?  That would be my only concern.  When Jeff and I had the Saturn and the Neon I always had to borrow.  It is nice having my own.</p>

<p>What year is the Xterra, and how many miles are on it?  And what kind of budget are you working with?<br>
<br>
The thing that scares me is that these dealers will always give you the shaft on a trade-in.  True, the longer you wait, the less you will get... but if you're going to invest that much in having the Xterra fixed (especially if there's a chance that you may wind up putting more money into it if this repair doesn't fix it), maybe it's best to hold on to it a little longer if you can.<br>
<br>
The Subaru wagons are great, sturdy vehicles, and they're great in the snow... this one already has 72k miles on it though.  The good thing is that since they are so very well built, it will probably last you quite a while... but how long do you plan on keeping the car and how important is it to you when the mileage starts getting way up there?<br>
<br>
The Saturn VUEs are nice, I also have heard many good things about them, but I have also seen them unable to get out of their own way in the winter.  You guys don't get the same type of snow we get, but it's nothing that a good set of tires won't be able to deal with.<br>
<br>
As far as Saturns in general are concerned, I still have my 2001 SC2 with just under 80,000 miles on it, and I love it, and have had minimal problems over the past 7 years (I bought the car in 2000, but it is a model year 2001).  I've got a great set of snow tires that I put on in the winter and I can get through just about anything.<br>
<br>
You mentioned towing capacity as something you may be looking for in a new vehicle.  What would you be towing?  The reason I ask is that a lot of these smaller SUV-type deals can accept a hitch, but they really don't have much in the way of actual towing capacity.  If you want any serious towing capability, that means a larger truck, and that means gas mileage goes out the window.  There are an awful lot of people who use these large trucks primarily as commuter vehicles -- that's just nuts, especially these days, with gas prices as high as they are.  So if the towing thing is something that's "nice to have" but you don't really have a specific need for it right now, maybe it's a good idea to stick with something a little smaller and more fuel efficient.<br>
<br>
If you have something specific in mind that you want to tow, make sure you check the actual towing capacity of the vehicle, as well as the maximum tongue weight it can support.<br>
<br>
pickled_cotton has the Toyota RAV4, those are very reliable as well.  They do have a bit of towing capability, but I think we saw a discrepency between what was in the owner's manual and what was listed online for that car.<br>
<br>
Yup, there are so many options to pick from.  Having a lot of choices is good in some ways, but it sure makes things confusing as well. :)  I am in the process of starting to evaluate other vehicles too, since my car is getting a bit older.  I am in the same situation as you -- I really love my car and don't WANT to trade it in either.  However, if I started to have major problems with my SC2, I may be swayed to start looking around a little more seriously too.</p>
