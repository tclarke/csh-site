Still moving....we ran out of boxes. We still don't have a bathroom so I'm not sure how that's going to work. The cat ran out of the apartment....she's been inside for nearly a week so hopefully she won't decide to run off for a long time. Now the brakes on the car are grinding so I have to go outside in the dark tonight to try and change the pads. I have no idea how we are going to get moved in time. If we do, how am I going to live in a house full of boxes and construction. I'm completely overwhelmed right now.

<p>Is there no plumbing or just no toilet, etc?  You could look into renting a porta-potty for a week, they usually run about $100 - $500 depending on the company.  <br>
<br>
Also, kick your construction people's asses!<br>
<br>
You could come visit me and John while they finish, but you probably need to stand over them with a bull whip.  <br>
<br>
Hope you have a bath &amp; finished house soon.</p>
