I woke up early (considering I was up till 2 at a party) about 9:30 so I could finish a paper and prepare for a presentation I was giving this afternoon. I gather Jenn and we head outside only to find the car with one very flat tire.  



Getting into the garage was a chore since my roommate's car was butted nearly against it. Being a skinny mofo I managed to squeeze through and get my hydraulic jack. There's still a problem though. Jenn's car uses small (3/4ish") lug nuts and has no lug wrench. The one my truck uses is larger....luckily, Kim answers the phone and offers to bring his over in case it fits. Many minutes later he drives in with one of those wrenches with four sizes. Wonderful. We change the tire and put his doughnut on (it's slightly larger than Jenn's) and get ready to go. Kim and Jenn go off to amuse themselves shopping and such and I head over to RIT. It is now 11:30 and I was less than amused.  



Well, things worked out and now I'm sitting here with a celebratory glass of cognac. MMMM. It's nearly bed time...early day tomrrow.
