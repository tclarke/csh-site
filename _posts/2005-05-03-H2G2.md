My boss rocks! He tooks us out to see Hitchicker's guide yesterday. He even paid for Jenn's ticket. I somewhat agree with many of the other reviews...good cast and good script but it was missing something. Many peopl esaid it just wasn't funny. I wouldn't go that far...it was humorous but it lacked the same energy as the book. I heard that they may make a trilogy (maybe not the trilogy in five). I think H2G2 was good enough to say the other stories have a lot of potential to be great.
