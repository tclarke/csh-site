Well, I tested for my blue sash in kung fu on saturday. Two and a half hours sitting on the floor, about forty five minutes testing and I passed...with a "Very Good." I felt confident and really feel I deserve the passing mark...I wasn't so sure about my last couple of tests...they were shakey. Feel free to ask for a demonstration of my kung fu fighting....I'm fast as lightning. ;)
