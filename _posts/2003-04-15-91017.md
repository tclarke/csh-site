Well, I've been back for a couple of days. The trip was great!! Had to drive a mini-van because the rental company knew how to take the reservation, they just didn't know how to keep the reservation.  



The hotel was [incredible](http://www.cariberoyale.com). There were complimentary mimosas and champagne while we were waiting to check in. After settling in, we drove to the Kennedy Space Center, which was closed (the visitor's center at least) so we went to Cocoa Beach instead.  



The concert was great (it was web cast via realone monday if you caught it). They cut out the part were EV passed around some wine (Jenn and I got some) but the rest of the concert was there (all 2.5 hours of it).  



Crashed in the big bed in our suite and woke up around 7:30. Coffee, a walk around the pool area and we were off to the airport header for Rochester again. *Sigh*, wish we had another day. Oh well, it was still a great trip.
