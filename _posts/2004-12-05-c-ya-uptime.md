I may haveÂ  to reset my router today. It's been up since 7/24, bout a month after I moved here. I took it down then so I could move a rack into the closet. Now I have to move the rack out. Still, doesn't pain me quite as much as when I had to reboot it after over 400 days uptime.   



Oh, and the other machine that will have to be brought down has been up since 10/10, when I finished installing it.
