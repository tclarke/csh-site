Saturday, Jenn and I met Brian, Anne, her sister, and mother in Toledo. They were up there for Jeanie's graduation and decided to go to the Toledo Zoo. We left the house a little after 7:30 and made our way up to Toledo. We parked and got out the picnic basket so we could have a mid-morning snack. I called Brian to let him know we were at the zoo. They were a mile or two down the road so our timing could not have been better.  



The zoo was awesome. We got to see the seals having their breakfast and chatted with a musician who was on his break at the Afrika exhibit. Next, we headed over the bridge to the rest of the zoo. We saw the white lions and I saw a momma merecat and four babies feeding while the dad stood guard up on a stump. I smelled fresh rhino poop and decided to move onto the hippos because rhino poop smells pretty bad.  



Other highlights included the new Dragon exhibit with all sorts of "dragons" from around the world. Chinese crocodile, dragon fish, and the star of the exhibit, a Komodo dragon! He was behind glass and standing up close to the glass so he was just a couple of inches away. The ape house was really neat. They had two groups of lowland gorillas. We were watching one of the silverbacks trying to get some alone time for lunch (one of the feamales and her baby kept following him). He climbed up a rope to a platform we were standing next to. He bumped into the glass as he did and I happened to be leaning on the glass at the time. He stood there watching us while he ate some lettuce and held the rope up so the others couldn't follow him up.  



There were plenty of other cool exhibits but I've got a meeting now so I'll not discuss them. I got some pictuers with my camera. If any came out good, I'll post them.
