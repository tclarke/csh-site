We are back from Rochester...got back last night around 11:00. The drive back wasn't too bad. We stopped at a winery in southwest NY, went to an ostrich farm, and drove on route 5 alone the Lake Erie coast. It added a little bit of time to the drive but it was fun.  



Thursday we pulled into the hotel hella-early in the morning (2:00am friday morning) and crashed. Friday we woke up and got ready for the wedding. We drove up the the park where the wedding was happening and hung out with some friends while we waited for everything to start. We sat with Eric and Tim (with his daughter) as there were only a few people we knew and most of them were in the wedding. The dresses and suits were awesome (picture post later when I get them off my camera). Civil War period outfits made by Gail and her mom. The ceremony was nice. Short but not too short. There was a bit of drama when Gail could not remember her vows (didn't expect too as they were long). Apparently the officiant had a copy he was supposed to bring and did not. They did some pre-canned vows and Gail was going to say hers towards the end of the ceremony. Her maid of honor was sent off to find the other copy and couldn't. Gail excused herself for a moment and went to find them. We soon found out that she couldn't find them either as the brides maids and her mom ran off to help. The vows were quickly located and everyone headed back to the ceremony. A slight hiccup that turned out well and will just make the day more memorable. The reception was a picnic lunch on picnic blankets. Sushi and tasty sandwiches. There was some dancing, more catching up with friends and lots of pictures. We drove around Rochester for a while, got some bubble tea, and went back to the motel to change. Gail and John were going to leave for their honeymoon friday night but put it off until saturday morning so they could spend some time with Jenn and I which was fantastic. We went to their apartment, watched Betsy's Wedding and ate take out Chinese food.  



Saturday we went to Brueggers for breakfast and I went to RIT. There was a kung fu class so I went to get a work out and see some more old friends. While I was there, Jenn went to pick up Katie and they had some girl time. We all met up at the RIT bookstore and we bought a couple of items there. (new key chains, etc.) Some more time was spent with Katie then we drove her home and headed off to meet up with Brian and Anne. The four of us had dinner at Sahara, a great middle-eastern restaurant on Clinton (near the South wedge diner). We went back to their place and talked for a while, had some Abbot's and started to put together a changing table for the baby. We had planned on going to Vertex with Katie, Cori, and Chad. Cori and Chad ducked out because he wasn't feeling too great (migraine I think). Katie ducked out for other reasons. After pouting for a little bit, Jenn got ready and we were going to get a beer at the Toad. Driving there we decided to go to Vertex anyway. We didn't stay very long but we did run into wjdresden whom I haven't seen in years. We went to Former Nick's after and got a plate. Had to verify if it's the same since it's been the same owners since Nick died some years ago...just a name change.  



Sunday morning we packed up and had another bagel...got some to bring back with us. We drove around Rochester a little more and looked at the new businesses and town houses on the river front...nice looking...definitely better than the empty lot that used to be there. There's an eyeglass store there called Specks in the City. We met up with Katie and mhaithaca at the Dinosaur and had a nice lunch. Jenn took his Audi for a test drive afterwards then we hit the road. As mentioned previously, we took the long way through southwest NY but other than that, drove mostly straight through to Ohio.
