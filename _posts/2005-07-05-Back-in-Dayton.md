It's been a long, but fun and relaxing trip. Jenn and I flew out of Dayton very early on thrusday morning. We were delayed a little because a marker light need changing on the plane. We arrived in Baltimore just in time to walk to the next gate over and get on the next plane. Both flights were smooth. We got into Boston about 10:30 and hopped on the T to Harvard square for lunch with a friend. The red line was very backed up due to a medical problem at Alewife so it took a little longer than normal to get up there. Lunch was a pizza bagel at Finagle a Bagel. There was chatting and good times. I was tired and my knees were hurting a little so we didn't poke around the shops at all. Back on the T to south station to catch the commuter train. We got there about 1 but had to wait until 2:15 to catch the Attleboro train so a little nap commenced. My dad met us at the station and pulled up just as we were getting of the train. We drove to Lincoln, unloaded the car and sat down for a rest.  



Friday we drove out to Warren and Bristol to look at India, etc. It was a nice day and the drive was enjoyable. We also went to a couple of malls and got a few things put on a registry. A busy and productive day, but quite boring to relate to all of you. :)  



Saturday morning, we went to Kennedy's for breakfast. I had two eggs, homefries, italian toast, hash, and coffee. Mmmmm! Seth and Laura's party was in the afternoon and some time was spent at my grandmother's helping to set up. There was tons of food and all of it was quite tasty. I saw some people I havn't seen in a while and had a good time. I helped my dad with some painting for a little while.Â  Later that night, Jenn's dad came by the house and talked our ears off for a little bit. Drove him back to his truck about midnight and nearly hit a fox on the way.  



Sunday was very busy. Pancakes in the morning. I painted some more. Didn't get as much done as I would have liked but every bit helped I guess. Jenn, Graham, Julie, and I went to see War of the Worlds. It was ok. Standard action flick. Simple, to the point story but it moved ok. Lots of action and explosions. Good CG. Pretty good acting. All in all...eh. After the movie, my mom, Jenn, and I went around town looking as some possible wedding/party locations. Dell's was consummed. We went over to Comberland to meet up with Jenn's dad again but some picnic action. Had a little food and chatted for a while. Saw the cuttest little calf. Headed back home. We packed up the car preparing for the long drive then went to bed.  



Monday, we were off on the road at about 6:30...slightly later than our 6:00 plan but not bad. We drove on 95 to NYC, across the the George Washington bridge and then started our long trek westward. Traffic was almost non-existant for most of the trip. It only look us about 2:hours 45 minutes to get to NYC. My mom drove to first leg then I switched just inside PA where we stopped for lunch at a rest stop. I drove the rest of PA then another rest stop just inside Ohio and my mom took over again. We stopped about halfway between Akron and Columbus for a quick dinner and I drove the rest of the way. We pulled into Fairborn at 8:30, unloaded the car, gave a quick tour of the apartment then went looking for fireworks. We stopped at Meijer for a snack, milk, and eggs then headed into the city via 3rd. We got to the ball park just in time to see the last half of their fireworks. They were good and loud. Back to the house for sleep. I'm now at work, getting ready for lunch soon.
