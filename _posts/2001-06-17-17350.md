Stupid [Frontier](http://www.frontiercorp.com). My net link has been down for a couple of days. It finally came back up but not before I retaliated. As much as I hate Time Warner and ignoring the lack of fuzzies I get from cable modems in general, I signed up for [Road Runner](http://www.rochester.rr.com). I really wish I could afford [Netssville](http://www.netsville.com). Oh well, maybe in the future.
