<p>holy crap...<br>
<br>
do you think that gwb can spell "responsibiliity?"<br>
<br>
do you think that he understands what it means to "take responsibility" for something?<br>
<br>
i have this picture in my head of gwb sitting in his office making life/health/world decisions for all of us, based on his consultations of a magic 8 ball...(not the drug, the toy...okay, probably the drug too. but not in this image.) "magic 8 ball, should we invade iraq?" (magic 8 ball) "without a doubt.." next thing you know, the phone rings and troops are being gotten out of bed because the fucking president got a message from god...</p>
