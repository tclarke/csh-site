Yesterday I had to work so I was up at 3am. Went to club last night for the first time in ages....so tired. Cedric played an awesome set and I tried to dance the whole night, but I had to rest after a couple of hours. Guess I'm getting too old for this.  



[We](http://www.livejournal.com/users/riffraff) were sitting downstairs by the pool table chatting with akean and there was a wonderfully amusing fight. One of the regulars who was quite toasty from a night of drinking picked a fight with a midget's brother. The midget (not just a short guy, an actual little person) tried to beat him down with a pool cue. Darkwave got the bouncer then ran at the midget to stop him from breaking stuff. Things slowly died down but not without the accompanied explanations, boasting, midgets going outside to kick some ass, etc. Sure to be the talk of the vertex mailing list this weekend.
