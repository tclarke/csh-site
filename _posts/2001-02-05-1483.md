Finally finished my Operating Systems lab!! I get to relax now. In other news, my latest batch of mead is doing ok. I think one may be going to vinegar,m but the other is clearing and settling at a healthy 9.5% alcohol. [Not Cows](http://www.notcows.com) is now a legal entity. Well, that's it for now.
