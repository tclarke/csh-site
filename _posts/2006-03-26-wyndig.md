So, we got to the dig last night about 12:30 or so. Some people had already left but the rest stayed and chatted the night away with Amber. Jenn and I both fell nearly asleep on the couch. We headed home about 6:30 and crashed as soon as we got in the house. When I woke up, I had a headache and neck ache so I was in a bad mood. Took a bath and some Advil. Just finished some tea and I'm feeling a bit better. Jenn went into work to fill in for someone and I'm at home contemplating dinner. I'm still a little icky, bored, and in a somewhat bad mood. Maybe I'll watch one of the movies I bought yesterday to cheer myself up.
