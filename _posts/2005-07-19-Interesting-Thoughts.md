from David Gerrold  



"No beliefs are true. They're _beliefs_. A belief system is something you have faith in regardless of the evidence. That's why all belief systems are equally valid. They're equally _invalid_. Therefore they're all deserving of equal respect. Little or none. Which is why simple human courtesy outweighs the value of any belief system.



Even if a belief system is accurate to the way the universe works, it's _still_ a belief system. That's its trap."
