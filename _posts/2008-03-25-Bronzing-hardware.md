Ok, here are the results of my little experiment last night. On the left is the original dresser hardware with the chipped paint. The middle piece has the paint removed. It's a different type of pull but from the same set. The right hand piece has been electroplated with bronze. There's still a little paint that I missed but it's just a test piece so you can ignore that.  



Opinions? Do you like the bronze of the original nickel better? The round pieces (the end pieces) don't have the brass center, it's all nickel.

<p>I personally like the middle one.  It drives me nuts when people paint pulls.  I think the bronze looks all right but it looks more natural in the nickel.</p>

<p>I like the nickel and the bronze.  It just depends on what you want to match it to.  Since you are electroplating, I don't have a preference.  If you were painting, I'd agree with pickled_cotton.  I hate painted pulls.  Very tacky.</p>
