I obtaned inernt access at the college across from my hotel and wrote a long post. Unfortunately, their net requirs one to log into a firewall and the login I was riding on timed out before I could post. I'm now at a free internet kiosk at the dayton airport....my flight is delayed.  



to summarize the other post...I was a bit nervous and Dayton is boring. My hotel, was nice and had a pool and spa. It is very close to where my interview was...waling distance. Both today and yesterday I got "selected" for additional screening at the airport..probably because I bought the ticket 2 days in advance and checked no luggage...oh well.  



I rocked my interview...I think they are going to make me an offer. The only thing, they want someone at the end of june which is a little ahead of my timeline....I can work something out if I get an offer.  



I'm a little tired and have a food coma so I'll be logging off now...besides, this keyboard sucks. I'm yping his sentance withot corrections.
