My new computer is finally here and in one piece. Spent most of the day getting it installed and up-to-date. Installed vista for now...got a free copy of vista ultimate at a miscrosoft event a couple of months ago so I figured I'd give it a shot. There's a second drive that'll have freebsd or ubuntu fairly soon. Couple of decisions still to make...I'm using an older sound card..not sure what kind I want to replace it with. I also accidentally bought 8gb ram instead of 4 but I might keep it anyway.

EVGA GeForce 8800GT with 512MB vram  
Antec Sonata III 500 Black mid tower case with 500W power supply
