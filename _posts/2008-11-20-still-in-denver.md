I'm still in Denver. It's been a fantastic week weather wise...60's and even 70 but it's cold and rainy today. The conference has been pretty good. Made some contacts and saw a couple of good presentations..generally worthwhile. The main conference ends today at noon but this afternoon and tomorrow there's a special UAS session. Tomorrow afternoon I'm driving up to Boulder to Ball to give a demo. Should be a nice way to wrap up the week. I'm back on a plane saturday morning. It'll be good to be home. I've got a few pics up on facebook and I might be some more up this morning.
