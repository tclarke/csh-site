Happy Birthday klutzywaitress!  
Happy New Year everybody!  



We got up late this morning and I made some pancakes for Jenn. She's in bed finishing them now while she lj's via her new wireless access point. I think she's also watching Isaak which is one reason I'm in here. :) I'll be poking on the puter most of the day so msg me if you are bored. I was thinking about going to TAMA at 1:00 for a new years workout they do every year...about an hour of hard cardio workout to get the blood pumping for the new year. I think I'm too lazy to do so tho.
