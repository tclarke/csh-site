Jenn and I will be in Rochester next weekend and we're looking for a place to crash. Coming in Thursday night and lwaving Sunday. Anybody got space for one or more of those nights?

<p>You and Jen are welcome to stay in our (empty) apartment on Friday &amp; Saturday.  We would like Thursday night to ourselves, and will probably be really grumpy Friday morning anyway.  Just close the windows and lock the front door when you leave.</p>

<p>If you can't find a place to stay, let me know and I'll arrange something with one of our friends.</p>

<p>Thanks for the offer...looks like we found a good price on a hotel so I think we are going to do that. See you at the end of the week!</p>
