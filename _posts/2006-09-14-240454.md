Finally got the car back today. His estimate was pretty much dead on. The latest estimate (after determining the actual problem) was about $2k after tax. I paid $2055 after tax. Got to pick the truck up today even though I can't afford the bill until pay day tomorrow because the transmission guy said he'd hold the check for a day. It works and it spiffy now with its new clutch and 1st gear.  



I was sworn in and briefed for my clearance compartments today so I'm fully up to par on my clearances. Applied for a base pass too. I'm now, of course, infinately more employable in the aerospace industry should I decide to leave Ball at a future date.  



Jenn will be here soon...time to get ready to go home.
