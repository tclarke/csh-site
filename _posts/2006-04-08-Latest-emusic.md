Lots of different stuff this month instead of a couple of albums. I caught up on some of my "save for later" selections.  
I grabbed this whole album. It's another Cleopatra tribute album. Not their best, but it's pretty good.  
Pretty typical Cruxshadows. Good, dancable modern goth that's not EBM.   
This album is ok, but I prefer them as FLA more. I grabbed two versions of Silence because I like that song.  
Ok, that's more like it. I was low on songs by this album so I just got Assasination, my absolute favorite FLA song, but I may get the rest of this album next month.  
I grabbed a remix of Rippin Kittin which is a catchy song. I'l starting to like Miss Kittin quite a bit as I hear more of her stuff. Hightly recommended.  
This is a Bush/911 themed protest album from turntablist god, Rob Swift. It's got some great grooves. Some of the songs are a little cheesy but overall it's a good album.  
Got three goa songs off this album. Reasonable but nothing special.
