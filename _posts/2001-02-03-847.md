I just finished checking my email and I'm waiting for the shower to free up. Last night I went to Piranha and ran into a bunch of people. I danced most of the night and I can home absolutely exhausted. I even made two wrong turns on the way home because I was driving on auth-pilot. Oh well, it's good to have a release from a busy and stressful week. A little Mazzy, some chai, and a lunch of sashimi and all will be good. I'm probably going to play a little D&amp;D; later since Brian is back from NYC. That's about all for now.
