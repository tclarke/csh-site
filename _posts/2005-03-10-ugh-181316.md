I'm sure you've all seen those images on websites where you have to type in the characters in the image but they warp them and add extra lines to prevent programs from automatically adding you. I was joining a yahoo! group today and was presented with the following image. Can anybody else read this because I know I can't.

I'm also annoyed that the DVD I spend all night building and burning is now a toaster. I think this time I'll build an image and use nero to burn it.  



Last (but certainly not least), congratulations Abigail, Robin, and Kim!

<p>pe77. The other lines are extraneous - you can tell by the fact they're much narrower and extremely irregular as opposed to the semi-irregular alphanumerics. Which helps cut down on bots, but doesn't make it easier for you or me.<br>

Yes, I've always enjoyed finding patterns in things :)</p>
