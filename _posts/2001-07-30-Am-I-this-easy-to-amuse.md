I was just remembering an old drink machine we had on [floor](http://www.csh.rit.edu). There was an "embedded" DECstation and a DECtalk attached to the serial port so it could announce drink drops. However, the DECtalk was on the console port so it spoke the entire boot sequence when the machine was turned on. When it got to one of the driver version strings, it didn't know that rev. was short for revision so it spoke loudly and clearly about the Revend 69.
