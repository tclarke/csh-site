We made it back to Rochester despite 25 mph wind sheer on the highway....take that wind!! I'm a little tired now and I'm going to wind (no pun intended) down for a little bit. Just to rub it in a bit more...still didn't see blushpumpkin. She'll have much to do to make up for this. :-PÂ  Oh, and Jenn came up with a disturbing idea...more on that later. *shudder*
