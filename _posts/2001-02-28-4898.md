It's been a few days since I've posted anything. I'v been busy trying to get a usable operating system on the PowerBook I inherited from Chip. Until I get a RAM upgrade and install OS-X I guess [Linux](http://www.yellowdoglinux.com) will have to do. Everything is nearly working, which is good. I'm about to eat lunch, which is also good.  



I showed a lot of restraint and bought a new [DVD](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0074812) instead of a stereo.
