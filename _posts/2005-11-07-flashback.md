I engaged in a typical LJ user boredom solving activity; looking at old posts. Some of you may be interested in my early posts as you havn't known me nearly that long. I was quite different back then; quite moody and gother-than-thou. [Here's a link](http://www.livejournal.com/users/retrev/2001/02/02/) to help you get started. Comments welcome!
