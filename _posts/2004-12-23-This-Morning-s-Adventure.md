So I (perhaps foolishly) decided to go into work today despite [bad](http://www.daytondailynews.com/localnews/content/localnews/daily/1223trappedweb.html), [record-setting](http://www.daytondailynews.com/localnews/content/localnews/daily/1223meteorology.html) [conditions](http://www.daytondailynews.com/weather/content/weather/special/1223slideshow.html). This kind of strorm, though not uncommon in Rochester, would probably have shut much of the area down for a day or so....more than 20 inches of wet, heavy snow in less than 36 hours.  



Anyway, I shovel the bottom couple of feet of my driveway when I realized that it provided a nice ramp to the foot and a half of snow on the road (our street has not been plowed yet) so I stopped shoveling. I powered my way out of the driveway, no easy feet as my driveway is more of a ramp into the below ground garage. (it's about 15 feet long and maybe a 25 or 30 degree slope directly into the garage) Someone had braved the roads before me so I drove in their tracks slip sliding away. It was quite fun. At this point I was glad for my New England learned, Rochester honedÂ  winter driving skill and my 4x4 with snow tyres. There was a car stuck in the next intersection but the tracks went around it. I would have stopped to help them get out but that would have lodged me firmly in the snow. Just down the street two cars were stuck at the next intersection completely blocking it. The church on the corner had already plowed their parking lot which has entrances on both streets so I slipped through there.  



The next part of the drive wasn't too bad as these were larger roads which had been plowed earlier that morning so they only had a couple of inches of slushy gook on them. There was a little trickery at a red light involving a large drift and a small hill but it was navigated with little trouble.  



Arriving at work was a different matter. There are two roads I can take to get to the parking lot. I chose the second as it is more direct. That road and the parking lot had nearly two feet of snow and massive drifts. They were in the middle of plowing the parking lot but were only about a third done and that was the back third of the lot. I plowed through, floored it at the end and burst through a drift that was nearly to the top of my hood. I parked in the barren driveway and walked in to be greeted by the one other employee who showed up today. He had the same thought as me...I started driving and figured it was easier to keep moving then turn around.  



So, here I am getting a few hours in at work. I've already called Jenn and told her to let her boss know she's not going into work later. (pretty much a given but it doesn't hurt to check in anyway)
