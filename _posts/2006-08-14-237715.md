Saturday's party went well...see klutzywaitress for a more complete review. Anyway...I got a bonus at work today...that will make fridge shopping a bit more pleasant..$900 woo!  



Went to the Yellow Springs brew club meeting last night. Great group of people. Very low key, informal group. Just a dozen home brewers enjoying some beer. There was a kegging demo last night. Jenn and I will be going back next month. There are no dues at this club if anyone else wants to go. Oh, and the owner of HaHa pizza is a member....talked to him for a while...he grew up on a small farm/homestead and has since raised small numbers of chickens in his back yard (as I want to do) and was a great source of information and suggestions.  



[Here](http://www.llbbl.com/data/RPG-motivational/)'s a little something amusing for those who havn't seen it.  



Finally, I'm planning on seeing Snakes On a Plane's first showing at Regal Hollywook. It's 12:50 friday morning...any takers?
