...I'll spill the beans to those on both our lists. Yes, I'm refereing to the amusing yet disturbing thing she alluded to [here](http://www.livejournal.com/users/klutzywaitress/399063.html).  



Last night we were getting some dinner at a chinese buffet and they were playing some musaky stuff. Instrumental Love Songs You'd Hear in an Elevator or some such thing. One song ended and gave way to the bleating of sheep. I thought to myself, "Is someone playing the hidden track from Tool's Undertow?" No, they were not. A piano joined in playing, When a Man Loves a Woman.



Now I know Fairborn is a little redneck, but it isn't this bad.



I was on the phone with my dad at the time and it took all of my will power to not blurt out laughing. Jenn was not so strong.  



Towards the end of the meal, we were finally getting over the Event when another song started. There were dogs barking. We left.

<p>Chinese Buffets are awesome... <br>

and it depends on what Fairborn.. Ghetto Fairborn, or middle-lower class fairborn.</p>

<p>The restaurant is across from Wright State. I live almost in beavercreek in a residential area off beaver valley road....so in neither case is it terribly ghetto.</p>
