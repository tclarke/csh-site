Reply with your name and I'll tell you something I adore about you.  
Afterwards, copy and paste this into your own journal so I may do the same.

<p>Hmm.....this is tough.....gotta pick one thing. :)<br>

You have a wonderful energy about you. It is contageous. When things are going well for you, everyone you know feeds on it and becomes that much happier. When you are down, you bring out the good samaritan in everyone. They desire nothing but to help you get thru what is troubling you.</p>

<p>Hmm...tough one...I don't know you that well but I'll see what I can do. I envy your job. I had my own company before and no matter how much I like my current job, it doesn't have the same freedom and satisfaction.</p>

<p>I envy your ability to uproot your life, change your situation, and settle back in as if nothing big had happened. It a free-spirit life with responsibility thrown in for good measure.</p>
