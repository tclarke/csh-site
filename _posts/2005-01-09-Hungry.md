I'm at work finish some stuff for tomorrow's rollup. It's time for lunch but I'm not sure what to get. I'm still in the mood for Skyline but I don't really want to get in the car and there are a plethora of fast food and sandwhich places in walking distance.  



In other news...we got some great deals at some clearance sales yesterday. I learned the rest of chu chi chuan on saturday and I'm about a third of the way through the second section of my tai chi form. I got to do the two person version of chu chi chuan on wed and having done lots of two person forms and flowing drills I picked it up very quickly. Not much else is happening...it's been busy at work but next week should be a bit slower.
