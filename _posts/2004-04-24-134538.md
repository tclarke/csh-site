I miss baking bread...havn't made any in a while. Right now, there's a honey-wheat sunflower seed loaf rising in my kitchen. It will accompany other tasty food on the first picnic of the season tomorrow. The location is undisclosed as it is a surprise for klutzywaitress.

<p>Looks like the location will be the exotic "spare bedroom" as it is raining complete with thunder and all that.</p>
