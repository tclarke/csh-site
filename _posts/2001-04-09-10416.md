Yesterday was productive and tiring. I worked on the car a bit, washed the mud off my driveway, washed [Kim](http://www.livejournal.com/users/riffraff) [Brian's](http://www.livejournal.com/users/fishslayer) cars, went grocery shopping, grilled some burgers, and visited Jeff and Meg while they were in town for a wedding shower. It was a pretty good day, but I broke a nice plant pot so I have to find a replacement now.  



[Brian](http://www.livejournal.com/users/fishslayer) and [Rachel](http://www.livejornal.com/users/fuzzybunny) signed a lease on a house yesterday. I'm gonna help them fix it up a bit over the next couplw of weeks.  



My mom and brother are coming to town the weekend for Easter.  



Time to go hack [Python](http://www.pythonlabs.com) now.
