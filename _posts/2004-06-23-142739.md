I'm finally back on the Internet. I'm atwork now and I've got a lot to do so I'll save a long update for later. Suffice it to say that I made it to Dayton without a hitch, am now living on hot dogs and pasta until my first paycheck, but everything else is going well. No AIM at work tho, so it'll be a while until I'm talking realtime again.
