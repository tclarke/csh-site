So, my uncle passed away recently. (xfref="&lt;a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/retrev/115317.html"&gt;http://www.livejournal.com/users/retrev/115317.html&lt;/a&gt;). As I said before, I didn't really know him but I do feel bad for my aunt and cousins. I'd like to go to the funeral next weekend but I'm not sure if I can spare three days from my schedule...I have so much work. Not even a laptop to try and get something done. I really hate thatÂ  significant things (bad and good) always seem to happen at the worst times.
