Ok, the rest of the answers [are up](http://retrev.livejournal.com/270044.html)   
I've got the day off today. Not sure what I'll go. Maybe I'll work on my taxes. Watching some tv right now while I eat breakfast.  



I sparred in kung fu on saturday. I must have taken a point hit to my right bicep and not realized it. It hurt on saturday...kind of like a charley horse on my arm. It was bruising a little bit yesterday and it hurt a lot. I couldn't straighten my arm past about 45 degrees. Today, it feels a little better but it is hella-bruised. If I think of it, I'll put a picture up later.
