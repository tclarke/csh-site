OOO!!! OpenBSD 3.6 is out. This one will definately be an upgrade for me...lots of good features!



  * SMP support
  * cleaned up DHCP server and client
  * from scratch (and audited) ntp daemon
  * pf rules optimizer and nested anchors
  * tcpdrop (to drop tcp connections)
  * NO MORE NMPCLISTERS! it's not a sysctl
  * better notplug support
  * isakmpd now supports NAT traversal and dead peer detection (RFC3706)!!!
  * i386 and amd64 cd bootloader does real boot loading instead of floppy emulation
  * loads of new functionality in bgpd(8) including auto adding received prefixes to a pf table and route reflection!
  * better NFS
  * more privledge separated daemons
  * lots of security and reliability fixes
