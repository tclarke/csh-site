I like my router.  



# /sbin/dump -a0 -f - | gzip -4 > /usr/local/var.gz  
# kill -TERM 1  
Enter shell or blank for sh:  
# umount /var  
# newfs -t ffs -i 2048 -m 15 /dev/rwd0e  
# mount /var  
# cd /var  
# gzip -cd /usr/local/var.gz | /sbin/restore -tvs 1 -f -  
# exit



/var now has twice the inodes  
no interruption in service except dhcpd and named went away for a while but all clients already had dhcp leases and they fell back to my provider's dns servers



Next project, set up file flags on the file system so changes are locked out except on config files. Also, mount /usr and / as r/o
