So, just got my tooth prepped for a crown. There's a temp crown there now and most of my face is numb.  



Jenn and I are flying to Boston tomorrow to pick up a car. We'll be in southern Maine, southern New Hampshire, Mass, Rhode Island, Conn, NYC, and Pennsylvania.  



Thanksgiving was good and the catering this weekend went well...I'm a bit too tired to go into details right now.  



I'm hoping to test in kung fu on saturday but I'm not sure if I'm ready. This is a hard test...defiantly the hardest yet and I hear it's the hardest until you test for a black sash. I'm going to miss class wednesday...we'll see how confident I feel when saturday rolls around.
