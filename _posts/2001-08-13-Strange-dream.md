I dreamt last night that I was in my parent's driveway filming a scene in a movie. A construction vehicle on catapiller tracks was supposed to drive across the driveway. At the same time, a truck comes over the crest of the driveway, hits a doorknob that was placed there and slams on it's breaks to avoid the construction vehicle. The driveway has been iced up, or it's possibly winter, so the doorknob goes scittering down the driveway. When the truck hits the breaks, it's wheels lock upand it slides past the construction vehicle. There was some other stuff that happened but it all seemed pretty normal. What I can't figure out is what was the doorknob for?
