Anybody stuck with nothing to do today? Feel free to stop by our place. We are eating about 2pm (we've got salad, yogurt soup, salsa, hot dogs, some burgers, and chicken). A little later, we'll be watching some movies, etc. Give us a ring if you want (937-879-0012) or stop by. (2224 Grierson Place, Fairborn, OH)
