I'm in GOS lab wondering wat to do. I just checked my mail, read some comics, etc. Maybe I'll do some more job hunting...hmmm  



On another note, I had a strange dream last night (two actually but I don't remember the second anymore). I dreamt that I was applying for a job back at ITS and I was about to be hired again. I think it was one of those dreams were you imagine what hell is like.
