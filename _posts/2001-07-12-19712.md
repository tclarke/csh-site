I just got back from my Existentialism class. I got a B on the test I took tuesday. Not what I hoped for but it'll make do.  



I have two more tests today during the RPJ power 4 hours and I have some [notcows](http://www.notcows.com) work to do before tomorrow evening.  



I've got some of my CS Theory project done but I need to change it a little bit. I'm writing a regexp "compiler." It will take a regexp and generate an NFA-epsilon (actually, a GNFA). It will then convert that to a lambda function or "optimize" it by converting to a DFA, minimizing, then converting that to a lambda function. In adition, I'd like to make a simple visualization function that draws a picture of the FA using Tkinter (the program is written in Python).
