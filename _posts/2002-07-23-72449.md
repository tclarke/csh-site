Jenn and I decided to take a trip to Niagara Falls yesterday. It was spontaneous and fun. We were real good with money and spend only $5 at the casino. The motel we stayed at was very inexpensive and simple. Small room with a bed, desk, and tv. The bathroom had the basics. We ate at Mama Mia's, a great little italian place I've been to a few times. Lunch today was mulagatoni at a little indian place. On the crappier side, I got a parking ticket for facing the wrong way. The street had one other car parked the same way as me, parking on one side only, and was so skinny it looked like a one way. Grrr!! Also, Mints was closed due to a "blackout" so no boobs in the face. All in all, a much needed break from the routine.
