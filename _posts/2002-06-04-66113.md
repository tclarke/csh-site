I had a great belated birthday party last night. The party started at the [Arigato](http://www.restaurantpix.com/Rochester/arigato2/arigato.html) where much food was consumed. I had to where this stupid outfit and have my pic taken (maybe it will follow in a later post). Present were: klutzywaitress, riffraff, pinkysaurus, gillybean, kukester, fishslayer, and Anne. Afterwards, most of us went to my place and were joined by ravenstar for some port. A [1994 Warres vintage port](http://portowine.server101.com/commerce/search/products/?product_id=Warres_V1994&merchant_id=1331), aka one of "the twins." It was a great wine with a frontal assault of pepper and spice that faded quickly to reveal a berry wonderland. Currants, raisins, and some orange flow nicely in this deep red wine. The heavy alcohol and tannins many people noticed when tasting this port upon its release in 1996 had melowed considerably but were still present indicating a much longer shelf life for the other bottle.
