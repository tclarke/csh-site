If you havn't heard, there's a new law (federal) going into effect October 28, 2004 called check 21. It allows for instantaneous (or nearly) clearing of paper checks, even after bank business hours. So, if anybody ever floats checks (write a check you can't conver knowing the funds will be available before the check clears...ex: write a check on thursday night knowing you'll get paid friday morning) you'll start having overdraft problems. Also, you'll probably stop getting cancelled checks back from your bank as most banks (the receiving bank, not yours) are likely to destroy the paper copies. If you need a copy to prove that payment was received you must ask your bank for a substitute check. Just asking for a copy of the check results in a copy which has no legal standing as a check.

<p>thats good and bad. good: it very nearly eliminates the need for paper checks that are made from resources that are not that renewable. bad: lots of lower income folks depend on being able to float checks for various reasons....<br>
