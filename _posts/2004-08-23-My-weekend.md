Jenn and I went to Indianapolis on saturday. She shopped at the mall most of the day and I went to GenCon. The con was sweet! I played some paranoia and joined a Werewolf LARP. I very briefly ran into pisceskitty and satyrblade tho I do wish I had more time to hang out with the LPP crew. During my paranoia game, some interesting events occured involving swapping of PC's and run away clones but I won't bore everyone with the details. (talk to me if you wanna know) The LARP was fun and the group that ran it (it's part of an ongoing game) was great...no uber-larpers or asshats! I pimped Deleria heavily and may have found some converts. Most were short on money due to the expense of getting to GenCon (they were mostly from chitown and tampa bay) but many promised to bug their local game stores to carry Deleria and barring that occurance, they know about LPP's website.  



Sunday morning we went back to Dayton and arrived in time for the Fairborn sweet corn festival. It's run by a local non-profit that offers scholarships for artists going to college (traditional art, music, woodworking, etc.) We volunteered to wear shirts for a local democrat who is running for congress. Couldn't hand out info cards because that's not allowed at the festival but we had a stack of the in case anybody asked for more information. The festival was fun and had lots of good food, many local artists and musicians, and crazy small town antics. (such as old people square dancing)  



Last night we tried to rent a paddle boat at Riverscape park (a park on the downtown Dayton waterfront) but we were 4 minutes late for the last rental. We went to the Oregon District (for you Rochestarians, think Park Ave) instead and got a snack and a beer at a local Irish pub. I had a german wheat beer and some excellant potato soup and Jenn had an irish snakebite (cider and guiness) and some bannana desert thingy.  



We wrapped up the night with some Good Eats and Daria.

I thought I wouldn't see kris and I just caught her running by me while I was taking a break from my paranoia game. I shouted and she ran up and gave me a big hug. I got disapproving mumbles from jenn who was on the phone (j/k bout that :-P)<br>
<br>
Anyway, I will not be at Dragoncon. I'll be in Crotchfester at a wedding...we gotta stop missing each other like this.</p>
