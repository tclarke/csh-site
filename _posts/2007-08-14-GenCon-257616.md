GenCon starts in a couple of days! I'm picking Graham up at the airport in a few hours and Brian is getting into Dayton late tonight. He's heading to Indy early tomorrow for the teacher seminars and the rest of us will be going later in the day. We're staying a little bit outside of town but that's ok, we saved a bundle on the hotel and it's not too bad a drive. My schedule is as follows:  



Thursday  
8 - Coteries, Clans, Covenants & Chaos  
12 - A Few Good Nazis  



Friday  
8 - Low Down Town Saturday Night  
12 - The Dungeon Crawl Good vs. Evil  
4 - The Voice of Treason Part 2  



Saturday  
11 - Firefly - Won't be Fooled Again  



Sunday  
10 - LEGO Pirate Wars



In between I'll be gaming on the floor somewhere, wandering the con, etc. I'm hoping to play some Deliria in there somewhere so if you want a game, let me know. If you want to meet up for a game, dinner, chat, whatever, I'll have my cell phone. 937-416-7167  
Give me a call or TXT me. Lots of parts of the convention center have poor cell reception so if you don't reach me, leave a message and I'll get back to you.
