I went to kung fu for the first time in over a week. It went ok, lots of advanced kicking drills: tornado kicks, jumping front kicks, linked dragon tail sweeps, and the like. Upon returning home, I popped the tube on for a minute and there was a Luc Besson movie on which I had not seen but have always wanted to watch. I must say, his version of [Nikita](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100263/) is definately worth watching. Much better than that [piece of crap](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107843/) that came out a few years later....this story was not meant to be a heart pounding action film, although Harvey Keitel was a pretty good Victor the Cleaner...not as perfect as Jean Reno tho.  



In other news, I'm nearly done with volume 1 of my Battlestar Galactica '05 DVD set. This volume will feature episodes 101 (33) and 102 (water) as well as some cut scenes from each episode and probably some informative text on each. I've finished converting the video and the building blocks for the menus are done (as well as a couple of the menus). I need to finish the layout, test, and burn. I've also started writing a [SWIG](http://www.swig.org) module to support [lua](http://www.lua.org). It will soon be available [here](http://www.notcows.com/svn/lua-SWIG/Trunk).

<p>The DVDs? You can come over sometime and watch, or borrow them (though my mom is already on the loan list), or give me some blank media and I'll make you copies.</p>
