It's been quite a day...first off, christmas was great. Jenn and I got to spend the day together and I was very happy abou that. Today, she and my mom got in a fight and she left upset. I took her to Lowell and headed home. I'll be meeting her in NH on sunday and hopefully we'll be back in RI briefly before going to Rochester but Jenn doesn't know if she can deal with seeing my family now. I hope she overcomes her anxiety and I hope my parents don't blow up at her. Ugh...why do I always end up more stressed after my vacations. I just wanna go home and ignore the world but I guess I need to show a little resiliance if I expect everyone else to do the same.
