My mom has been in town all week. (she leaves tomorrow) She's been helping us paint the house. So far, we've finished the dining room and have a majority of the bedroom painted. They are going to finish the bedroom today and do some sore of paint treatment in the entry alcove and the fireplace alcove. We do have pictures but they are on Jenn's laptop and I haven't uploaded them anywhere yet. When I get them online, I'll post some.  



Anyone interested in password security and how to choose good passwords should read [this](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/01/choosing_secure.html). (it's a trick question, you are all online and thus have some passwords so you should all be interested in choosing good passwords)  



I read an article today on a satellite cluster (6 small satellites) in LEO. They are basically fancy GPS receivers. Instead of calculating lat/lon/alt they use the signal delays to calculate how much the GPS signals refracted in the atmosphere. They use this to map the temperatures in the upper atmosphere. They have gathered the most accurate upper atmosphere temperature maps to date....using a system designed to show your location on the Earth. This is why I don't design weather satellites (or any satellites for that matter). I would never have come up with something this clever.

<p>Damn, I guess I should stop using "password", huh.<br>
<br>
And maybe I should go change the combination on luggage. 1-2-3-4-5 doesn't seem so good either.<br>
