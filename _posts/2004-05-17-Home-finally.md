My flight out of Dayton was 2 hours late due to the weather. I arrived in Chicago with just enough time to catch my connection, which happened to be cancelled. There was another flight out to Rochester at the same time which was originally supposed to go out at 6:40 CST. I switched my ticket to that flight, called my parents to have them send out the new flight number, then got on the plane. At this point the ground delay was only 45 minutes or so (vs. the 3 hours that made my DAY-&gt;ORD flight late). I'm home now, only about a half hour late.
