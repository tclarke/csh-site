I missed this week's Firefly (Out of Gas) . Anybody have a copy? (VHS and local or digital and anywhere?)

<p>We have them all on the HD on the TiVo. And K added the TurboNet card and is working on checking a burn of Invader Zim. If that works all right, should I request he burn you a copy, or would you prefer VHS?</p>

<p>SWEET!! Definately CD. VHS is a last resort (I'm hoping to get rid of the damn thing soon). I also missed this weeks enterprise if you have that too (for some reason, my recuring records didn't activate this week....hmmm, have to look into that).</p>

<p>Don't have Enterprise. I'll check the people I know who Tivo, though.<br>
<br>
The first VCD's video came out great, but the sound is a little high-pitched and fast. Kurt thinks he has a fix. I'll let you know if we get it all set.</p>

<p>VCD has been burned. First hour long out of the TiVo. It looks sweet!<br>
<br>
How would you like me to get it to you?</p>

<p>I'v still got some of your tupperware so I'll just head over there at some point and initiate an exchange. I'm gonna try and get there early next week (perhaps sunday or monday). I'll let you know.</p>
