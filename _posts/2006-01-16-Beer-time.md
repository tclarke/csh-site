Ok, I really want to make some more beer right now so I'm planning a brew party. Who wants to brew some beer with me? There will be consumption of other beer, etc. I'd like to shoot for this weekend. Who's in? Let me know what kinds of beer you like so I can get a recipe together...or we can experiment a little. I'm thinking an abby ale.

<p>I think we'd love to come, although I haven't talked to Tim about it.  But this weekend is out for us - we're booked, I believe.  But if you have another one soon, plan on seeing us!</p>
