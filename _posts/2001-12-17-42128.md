Grrr...I'm sitting here trying to amuse myself for an hour before class. I'm chewing my fingernails which are a mess now.  



[Sara](http://www.livejournal.com/users/sberg) is in Roch for the day so I had lunch with her and we ran into Trekka which was neat. Parts for my DVR have arrived but I'm having issues getting an OS installed, I need for RAM (anyone have 64meg sitting around?) and I think the floppy drive is dying. Parts I still need: big hard drive, IR remote. Parts I still want: better soundcard (duplex card...cool MIDI/synth stuff not needed but it should record nicely), new MB and proc (celeron 400-500ish would be great....doesn't need to be super cooled but it's plenty fast enough), smaller case preferable convection cooled, or single quite fan, more RAM (as stated above). If anyone wants to donate, let me know (cash and parts accepted :) )
