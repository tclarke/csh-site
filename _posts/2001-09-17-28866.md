I have finished my homework for the week, just in time to get more tomorrow. I'm taking some time to read for a bit. I'm also remember how much my life sucks, which is bad. I don't even know why...I can come up with some reasons but not enough to justify my feelings. Oh well, life goes on, I guess I just have to distract myself and hope for better than the worst.
