I just got out of my existentialism class. I was greatly annoyed today. The prof was asking a series of questions with obvious answers so that she could demonstrate a certain principal. There were a few people who just wouldn't give a straight answer. Obviously, it's good to question precepts especially in a philosophy class, but there are times when this is an obvious waste of time. Example: the professor was trying to explain belief without knowledge in a non-theological situation. She said, "I believe it is raining outside. You can perform scientific tests (pet scans, etc) and determine that I truly believe this. However, you can look outside and confer with others and determine that it is not actually raining outside. Is this belief without knowledge?" There were multiple people who, instead of answering yes (I hope this answer is obvious in an everyday context), they would say things like: "It is raining somewhere on earth" or "Perhaps it is raining and we are all being deceived by our senses.  



Do these people not realize when a point is being made? Do they assume that they have to decompose all things to the nth degree simply because it is a phylosophy class? Are they unable to step out of an epistemological context, even for a minute? I find it difficult to believe that many true skeptics ended up in my summer existentialism class at RIT.  



Am I even partly correct here or am I in a generally pissy mood that I'm channeling to this situation? I don't really care I guess...time for lunch.
