Busy week...went to see Lyle Lovett last night (Jenn won tickets on the radio). Not usuallt a country fan so my expectations were low but I was pleasantly suprised. Much of the music was closer to jazz and big band than country. The whole band was excellant and Jenn and I had a good time.  



Work has been crazy...still looking for two new programmers for the project. Lots of meetings this week including about possibly open sourcing part of the project which will be neat. Also, I get indoctrinated tomorrow. Finally got my last security clearance...after over two years which is average I guess. Anyway...that means I get a base pass and will probably end up over there on occasion instead of troubleshooting over the phone. I do get access to the base facilities tho...  



I didn't go to kung fu or tai chi saturday but did go last wednesday and on monday. Learned part of my long staff form (finally)...it's the last thing I need to learn for my next rank...still need to clean up everything before I can test. Class tonight...not sure what we'll be working on.
