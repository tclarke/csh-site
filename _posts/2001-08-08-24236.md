It is very hot here. This sucks. I should study a little more for my finals tomorrow but I don't really want to do anything right now. I'm working on a simple programming contest for CSH to get everyone ready for the start of school. I'll post it once I finish it.  



[Phyber](http://www.livejournal.com/users/phyber/) might come and visit us this weekend (under the guise of a nick's run) That would be neat since I havn't seen her in over a year.
