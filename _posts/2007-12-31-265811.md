Happy birthday rifraff. Time to join us in sanctuary (ohio?).  



Anyway, I've got the day off again...last floater holiday of the year. I don't feel like watching tv today...did some cleaning over the weekend. I'm in the mood for a game but I'm not sure what to play so I'm scanning the abandonware sites. Any ideas? I'll be logged in to IM most of the day...my jabber server is down (bad erlang update and I don't feel like fixing it right now) but I'll be logged into gmail chat and occasionally aim.
