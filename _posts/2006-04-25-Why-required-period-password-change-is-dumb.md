[Here](http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/weblogs/spaf/general/post-30/)'s an interesting post asserting that required period password change does little to help security.

<p>Phooey, link is farked.<br>

Though the premise doesn't surprise me. If you have to keep changing your password, chances are you won't remember what the new one is... so you put it on a post-it note under your keyboard... or make it something easy to remember.<br>
<br>
Voila, "security". :P</p>

<p>That's part of it, but it goes beyond that. He explains the basic classes of password secuity breaking vectors. (such as guessing, cracking, exposure, etc.) and explains why changing passwords on a set interval doesn't prevent most of them.<br>
