Ok, here I am still feeling a little diconnected with reality, but in a good way. Just finished eating lunch (sushi and miso soup). Day 6 of my Mazzy kick, wonder what will be next? Probably classical expressionism; maybe I'll find time to play my oboe again.  



Brain and Rachel came over last night and we played a little D&amp;D; and watch Fight Club. I slept in late and watched some tv in bed. I'm trying to get some work done today but I don't think it's going to happen, I'm too out of touch.
