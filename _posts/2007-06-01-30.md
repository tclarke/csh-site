Well, I'm 30 today. Not sure how I feel about it. Had dinner at Maharaja last night. We spent a lot more money than usual but everything was fantastic. Two lamb dishes, a great chicken biryani, a sea bass curry and butter lobster masala. Add in an appetizer or two, plenty of break and rice, and some bread pudding for dessert and you've got quite a dinner.  



We are going up to Canada today for the weekend. We'll be staying [here](http://zenculture.com/) and we're going to the opening of a new winery. I'll take pictures with my new camera and post some when I get back.
