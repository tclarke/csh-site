[Some of these are pretty funny](http://www.dieselsweeties.com/archive.php?s=1310). Some of the better ones:



  * New York - Powered by clean-burning natural sass
  * Maine - The raisin to Canada's grape
  * Colorado - We are **so** high
  * Mossouri - Show me your state, I'll show you mine
  * Ohio - It really seemed like a good idea on paper



And my personal favorite.



  * Iowa or: how I learned to stop worrying and love the corn

<p>Yea...but I've decided long ago that it doesn't mean what most people expect. NH has no income tax. It's not that most people in the state wanted it that way, they just killed the ones who didn't.</p>
