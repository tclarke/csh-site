Friday I went climbing for the first time in a long time. I'm definitely not in climbing shape anymore...the calluses on my fingers are long gone any my finger strength leaves much to be desired. Still, I had a good time and should go more often.  



SG1 was good, but a little disappointing for a series finale. At least there are gonna be a couple of movies to tie up the plot lines. Atlantis was..OMG...I'll not spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet.  



Sunday, Jenn and I cleaned my office and reorganized her closet a bit. Great deal on some closet shelving at k-mart. We finally got rid of the bed in the living room. Our living room looks so much more open now. Jenn is happy too as we can paint the living room.

<p>The SG-1 finale was really weak in my opinion.  If it weren't for the two movies they've got coming and the spin-off series, I'd be really disappointed.<br>

Glad to see Jewel Staite join Atlantis.  Huge fan of hers for years.  It's very shiny!  :)  She's aged really well in a couple of years.</p>

<p>I'm not so sure about her character yet..she's on board for 14 eps I believe. I'm just not feeling the character, but she was barely in that episode so I'll give it some time.</p>
