Looks like Google talk beta is out early. It is jabber based with an extension to hook into a VoIP system (so you can talk via voice if using the google talk client). It supports any jabber client for im functionality. It uses your gmail account and automatically adds your gmail contacts to your buddy list. [Check it out](http://talk.google.com). If you try it, send me an IM at retrev at notcows.com (should look like an email address). I also have some services on my jabber server that you are free to use. (such as a multi-user chat and AIM gateway)



UPDATE: It appears google talk has disabled server-to-server connections and thus you can only communicate with other google talk users. I've sent an email to them to see if they will be enabling this. Poo.
