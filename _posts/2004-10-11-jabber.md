So, the notcows.com jabber2 server seems to be stable, etc. so I'm opening it up for people who would like an account. Right now, it's just got a basic jabberd2 setup andÂ  multi-user chat but I'm planning on adding some additional features (user search, etc.) I probably won't add any gateways but there's a very reliable, free jabber server with the standard gateways (AIM, yahoo, icq, etc.) that I use without problems. Additionally, this server will function as a home for a Deliria bot I'm writing (reserving chat rooms, handling card draw's, storing character info, etc.). If you want access, reply to this, send me an email, or msg me and I'll hook you up.
