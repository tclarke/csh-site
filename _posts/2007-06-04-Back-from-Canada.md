We made it back from Canada in one piece. We stayed at an awesome b&amp;b..the; Fujisawa Zen Garden. The owners, Francis and Sara were super nice, the prices were very reasonable, and it was very relaxing...I suggest you all go...that goes for Rochester people as well as Dayton..it's about 5.5 hours from Rochester and 4 hours from Dayton...perfect for a weekend trip, especially a long weekend. All the pictures we took are available [here](http://picasaweb.google.com/pythonpimp/TrevorSBirthday2007). Most are annotated so I won't go into too much detail. riffraff, we did have some absinthe but didn't bring you any...you're not too far from Canada, get some yourself. :-P g6w6j6r, we saw this on the way home and thought you'd appreciate it.

Finally, we took a short video of the kitchen so everybody can see the new paint. Get it [here.](http://www.csh.rit.edu/~retrev/livejournal/2007-06-03/kitchen.avi)

I like the waterfall pic coming off of mt fuji, but it just seems weird.<br>
<br>
The rest of the stuff looks nice.</p>

<p>The garden is named after the city of Fujisawa (near Mt. Fuji) which is the sister city to Windsor (the closest city to the garden). Also, the owner spent some time living in Fujisawa. He actually has a piece of Mt. Fuji there (just a small rock).</p>
