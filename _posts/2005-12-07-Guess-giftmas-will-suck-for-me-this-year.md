**Dear Santa,**  



This year I've been busy!  



In May I had a shoot-out with rival gang lords on the 5 near LA (-76 points). Last Sunday I broke fishslayer's X-Box (-12 points). Last Friday I committed genocide... Sorry about that, lisaisabella (-5000 points). In October I ate my brussel sprouts (1 points). In February icedemon and I donated clothes to the needy (11 points).   



Overall, I've been **naughty** (-5076 points). For Christmas I deserve **a moldy sandwich**!

## Oh Great Cthulhu!



I have been an extremely assiduous devotee this year.



In February, I defiled the grave of that traitor, Lovecraft (90 points). In November, I bombed a cultist gathering (-100 points). In January, I legally changed my name to Randolph Carter (-40 points). In August, I rammed a ship into you (sorry Cthulhu!) (-1000 points). In May, I wore an Elder Sign (-10 points). In June, I exposed [![\[info\]](http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif)](http://livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=misslunakitty)[misslunakitty](http://livejournal.com/~misslunakitty) to soul-rending horrors (250 points). 



In short, I have been very bad (-810 points) and deserve to be sent to sleep with the Deep Ones.



Your humble and obedient servant,   
retrev
