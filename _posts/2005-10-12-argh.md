Yesterday we went to some thrift stores looking for halloween costumes. The first one we went to almost had two important pieces to a good Malcolm Reynolds costume. There was a fabulous brown coat that was just a bit too big to work with and there were boots that matched Mal's quite well except they had big heels. Oh well, maybe another store will have somethine.
