Hoping to get lots more painting done this weekend as I have been lax all week. I'm more rested from a couple of early nights. pickled_cotton is coming for a visit tomorrow and there's a party later that night that Jenn and I might attend. That's about it for my weekend plans.  



Work is getting interesting. The project I'm on is going open source and we are getting quite close to a source release. (just waiting on an ITAR release from DC) It's the first product from BALL SES to go open source and we are acting as guinea pigs. If this works well, some other projects will likely follow the same path. This is good for a bunch of reasons, the main being that the DOD is making a push to use open platform (which includes open source) software for workbenches, infrastructures, etc. to cut back on costs. There's only one other open source product out right now which is close our system functionality and it's much less mature. We've been talking with them as well about some code sharing, etc. to leverage the best parts of both products. (we are already using a piece of their code in our product) Anyway...is anybody looking for a job? We are hiring someone to head up the open source end of thing here. They'd be a liaison, etc. to the community as well as a developer for the product. Let me know if you're interested.
