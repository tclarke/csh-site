Jenn and I are hosting a Fancy Pants shindig on Saturday, November 26.  
What is a FPS you may ask? Well, we have been planning to host a party  
for all the Dayton folks who did not make it to our wedding. This was  
going to be a mini-reception and wine &amp; cheese extravaganza. We have  
also volunteered to host a shindig for the local Firefly fans. We  
thought to ourselves, "Hmmm, why not combine these two parties?" This  
way, we don't need to plan two parties and friends from the various  
groups and cliques can hang out.  



It is a Fancy Pants party, so feel free to dress up, wear just fancy  
pants, or wear clothes you'd clean the garage with; anything goes! We  
will be supplying some snacks, hor dourves, soft drinks of some sort,  
homebrewed beer, wine, and perhaps some martinis. You may bring your  
own beverages or donate something to snack on if you'd like but all  
that is optional.  



Activities will include socializing, some music, games, movies,  
Firefly, and whatever else you can think up. Since we are in  
Dayton and some of you will be coming from afar, we do have a futon  
and some floor space if anyone needs to crash. Also, I'd appreciate an  
approximate head count so I know how much stuff to get.  



The party will begin in the early evening (6ish) and will run all  
night. Address and directions are below.
