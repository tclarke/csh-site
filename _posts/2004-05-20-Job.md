Havn't heard about the job yet but I did get this email from the guy who wasn't able to make it to my interview.

Hello Trevor,  



I apologize for not being at your interview and having you wait afterward. I was not notified about your interview time and was scheduled at the same time to be at our customerâ€™s site. You were one of the candidates highest on my list. I am very disappointed that I could not be there.   



Todd Johnson spoke very highly of you and I trust his opinion. If you have any questions about the job, I would be glad to call you anytime. This job is challenging and very rewarding. I hope that we can work together in the future.   



Thanks,  



John
