I just finished my distributed system project. Submitted it and now I'm waiting for confirmation that it compile ok for my prof (shouldn't be a problem, I didn't use any phunky libraries). Now it's time to find [Jenn](http://www.livejournal.com/users/klutzywaitres) so I can eat lunch. I wonder where she is....
