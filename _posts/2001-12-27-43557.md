I've finished my book and don't feel like starting the next one. I'm sick of playing Stronghold and Graham is using his PS2 so mindless SSX is not an option. I could work on my DAI project but I don't have the motivation. There's always that LISPos I've been meaning to write but I'm not motivated to do that right now either. Hmm....what can I do. Blah. Maybe I'll go get tea [here](http://www.tealuxe.com) and start my next book.
