We've been here for a few months and still havn't been to any of the local clubs so we went to Revolution last night. It was fun: good music, ok bar, nice layout, good crowed (not too crowded), and an inexpensive cover. (ladies in free) Having not been out much recently (Vertex in September, and not since June before that) I may have gone a little overboard. I'm a bit sore and my voice is all but gone. Oh well, not like we do this every week anymore. (/me wonders how he managed to go 3 or 4 times a week every week for a summer...)  



Today I'm going to finish cutting the wood for the shelves and stain them. Later tonight I'm meeting Dave and some other people for poker which should be fun.
