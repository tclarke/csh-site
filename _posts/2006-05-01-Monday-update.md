Just letting everyone know my knee is much better today. I can stretch it all the way out with only a little discomfort. Cleo goes back to the vet for a checkup today..her eye looks much better so she should get a clean bill of health. She really wants to go outside so I hope everything is ok today.  



working_dreamer, still planning on dinner wed. I'm pretty sure Jenn will be working so you'll get to meet her but she probably won't sit down and eat with us....probably depends how busy it is. Anyway, we can plan on meeting at the restaurant about 5ish? As for directions, go south on Fairfield Rd. Just before the mall, there's a Walmart/Sam's Club complex on the corner of Fairfield and New Germany-Trebein Rd. Just past Sam's Club is a small strip mall with a hair salon, etc. That's where the restaurant is....Maharaja of Dayton. If there's a change in plans, let me know. If you need to reach me offline, my cell is 416-7167.

<p>My neighbor is a big Ben Folds fan. He is likely already going but I could ask anyway. He might be interested in buying a ticket from you.</p>
