So, I'm not going to have enough money available this weekend for the disciplship (or any of the seminars for that matter). There will be other opportunities however, and my week was brightened quite a bit when I found out that Jenn got a promotion at work. (after only 4 months!)  



Jenn and I took Amber out for sushi last night. It was YUMMY! We sat at the bar and got yummy squid salad! The sushi chef was quite chatty too. It was fun!  



Well, off to cook...turkey meatballs, pasta, and maple acorn squash await me.
