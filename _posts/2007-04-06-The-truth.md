The real reason goth guys are always depressed is that goth girls' outfits are way cooler.

<p>hey Trev! <em>smiles and waves</em><br>

yeah, this is soooo true. Which reminds me, do you know any online places (or retail other than Hot Topic) to get goth guy stuff that's good. I've done a google search and .. bah :/ I'm looking for anything good, but especially an awesome pair of boots. I have most of the stuff I need, but the guy is lacking.. lol.</p>

<p>I second this.  Goth guys always look nifty when they take the time to put things together.  I think the only real difference is in corsets and hair... and guys can wear corsets too, and they just need to take more time primping.</p>

<p>though that site has some really awesome guy-clothes.  Not too fond of the pants.  Only look good on skinny guys.  :(</p>
