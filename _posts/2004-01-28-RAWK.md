So, we almost got stuck in the driveway again today...too much snow. We get home and Greg (roommate) is starting to shovel. I grab the other shovel and help. My neighbor, who's snowblowing his driveway, worms his way over and starts doing the end of our driveway. He did as much as he could (the snowblower couldn't get enough traction on the grass in the middle of part of the driveway. Man, my neighbor is awesome. He'll be getting a random gift or two from us.
