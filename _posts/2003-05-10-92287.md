Yesterday, [Jenn](http://www.livejournal.com/users/klutzywaitress) and I went to the Lilac Festival opening night concert to see Sarah Slean. It was a great concert and much enjoyment was had. We may have been on the news (channel 7) but I havn't watched the tape yet to find out. We also met Sarah after the concert. She was quite friendly but looks a lot different up close than she does on stage. Some guy who saw her write up in the Freetime and decided to go to the concert stopped down to say hi. While we waited for her to sign some autographs he folded her a rose from red and green paper napkins (complete with a drop of rose water).  



Afterwards it was off to the Dinosaur BBQ to see one of Jenn's professors play with his band. This is the second time we saw them and they were much better than before. We hung out with another guy Jenn knows from that class and Stacey Wronkowski. Prof. Engstrom was seen in the vacinity of the bar and we danced till about midnight.  



Today, I went to kung fu. Now Jenn is getting a hair cut and I'm gonna pick up some groceries for a picnic (back to the lilac festival). I don't have too much left as far as school work (just a presentation, another project, two tests, and my kung fu 1st rank test). I expect updates will be more frequent as I will have more time.
