Getting married today...I just got up and I'm about to go set up chairs and stuff. Didn't sleep a lot last night but I'm not really nervous now. Nearly had an altercation with a jack ass in a pickup truck last night but I'll write about that later. Here's a little nugget for now.  
![](http://www.notcows.com/albums/TJ_Wedding/P9300032.sized.jpg) Here we are last night in Providence at Waterfire. There were fire dancers there this weekend which was cool. We got a ride on a water taxi to look at the whole Waterfire exhibit and had a beer at a local brew pub.  
From left to right, front to back: Terrasha, Meg, Sara, Me, Jenn, James, and Katie

<p>It's funny because earlier that day when I was at my shower an attendant at the hotel said I had a glow about me. Here's hoping it was of the non-toxic variety. :) <em>cheers</em></p>
