I've come to the realization that nothing in my life has any real meaning and even the usual distractions bore me.


<div id="comments"><h4>Comments:</h4><div class="lj-comments"><ul>
<li class=subject><h3>fishslayer: Yea no shit</h3>
<a id="comment-3"></a>
<p>life is a series of actions that end up in death.<br>
<br>
the trick is to just have some fun waiting...  "real meaning" is just some bullshit idea that someone with a PhD made up to sound important<br>
<br>
To have things have meaning, they just have to have meaning to you...</p>
</li>
</ul></div></div>
