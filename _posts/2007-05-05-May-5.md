Happy cinco de mayo!  



I finished the fourth garden today and got it planted. Cleaned up the yard a bit and trimmed some headges out front. My hops came in the other day so I planted those. Got 2 rhizomes...a Kent Goldings and a Sterling. If they work out well, I may get a couple more next year. Cleaned everything up and headed inside to watch SG1..OMG! Just in time too as it is now raining.  



Jenn and I are going to get some food and a couple of drinks. Pepito's in north Dayton. Call if you want to meet up.
