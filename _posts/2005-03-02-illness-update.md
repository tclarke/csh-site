I just got back from my doctor appointment. A brief background...I have cold symptoms for a few days  nearly two weeks ago. I still ahve a slightly runny nose and a cough that won't go away. I went to the doctor in case it's bronchitus. My doctor is pretty certain it's not bronchitus but there's a slight chance it's pertussis. That's right...whooping cough...leave it to me to get an Obscure, Old-Timey™ disease. It's still early tho and she hasn't tested me yet as they usually wait a little longer before doing a pertussis test but I've got the symptons. (the problem is, they are also the symptoms of a cold or other viral respirtory infection) Apparently pertussis infection in adalescents and adults has been increasing but it is still pretty rare. The test is easy (nasal swab and a culture) but I'd have to go to a lab to get it done, it's quite expensive, and can take a week or two to see results. (that's why I havn't been tested yet) I got a prescription cough syrup (hydrocodone) and instructions to call the doctor's office if I havn't improved by monday. If that's the case I assume I'll get tested for pertussis and probably put on anti-biotics right away since the test takes so long to come back.  



That said, anyone who's had contact with me over the last two weeks and is sick: even though there is a cold going around everywhere, keep an eye on your simptoms. If you feel better in a couple of weeks except for a nagging cough that comes is (possibly violent) spells, you might want to go to your doctor just in case. (although, as I said, occurances are still quite rare apparently pertussis is pretty contageous during the initial stage especially since it appears to be a common cold and thus people pay it little heed)

<p>Interesting, I will keep that in mind. I can't believe it takes to long before they can get the results back.</p>

<p>They grow a culture and apparently the bacteria is very slow to grow. (probably why the disease lasts so long).</p>

<p>Well they pre-lim the dish that your bacteria is on 24 hours after they plate it. They usually note that there is normal flora and other normal things on it. Incubate it for another day to see if there is anything of intrest... if so they take that colony of bacteria and put it on a different agar plate and do the same. They watch it more carefully and isolate it and determine from that colony that it is whatever they said it was. In your case Pertussis. It takes longer than 2 days if it is something more serious than strep or bronchitis. Anyway, thats a short explanation. <br>
<br>
I hope you feel better and hope that its NOT pertussis.</p>
