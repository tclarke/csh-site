My stuff made it to Dayton on saturday and with some helped we got everything into the house by dinner time. There was a minor incident unloading the MG but everything else went smoothly. We had a great weekend with my dad and Jenn's dad. Mostly unloading and hanging around the house resting.  



Ball is looking like it'll be a good place to work. Everyone is friendly, professional, and quite knowledgable which is a good environment to work in. I'm still waiting for the IT department to get some somftware installed so I can get some real work done but I've been helping out the other Solaris guy with some build environment problems.  



I have a little bit of money from my final Rochester pay checks which will help out quite a bit. Maybe we can explore the area a little bit now that we have some money. It may still be a little while until the Internet once again reaches my home but I'm working on that.  



Lunch time is just about over so I'm getting back to work.

<p>Our driveway is very steep. When the flat bed was lowering the car into the garage, it slid on the driveway causing some damage to the trim next to the garage door.</p>
