Just got back from the  fireworks display. I was at Cobb hill. Tried to meet pinkysaurus and ravenstar but searching was hopeless. Oh well, I had a wonderful evening with my girlfriend. Now we are sitting on the porch with norton. It is very nice out.  



Oh, and I fixed that routing issue with my DSL. I had to ignore the gateway they gave me and set the default route to the net my nic is attached to.
