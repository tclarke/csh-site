Well, quite a bit has happened over the last few days. I'll summarize.  



Went to the Toad twice, ran into Bill, Gillian, and Bob the first time. Friday, we went to the Great Guiness Toast and hung out with schmitty. Met a friend of his and played darts with them. riffraff and I won...a good time was had. We also saw Jesseca and found out my old roommate Noel is now married.  



Tonight we headed out to Jay's. Meg and Jeff where there and we bumped into Sercu.  



I got some new DVD authoring software which actually works well and does exactly what I want. I just burned my first DVD. It has the first two episodes of Earth2. Works well and it's on a DVD+R so I've verified that they work with my DVD player.  



Time for bed now I think.

<p>ya know, that's what I loved about living in Rochester. No matter where you go, you always seem to bump into people you know. :) <br>
<br>
the last time I was there, we went to dibella's for sunday lunch, and bumped into a good 5 or 6 people we knew. now granted, dibella's is a hot spot, but still. <br>
<br>
randomly bumping into friends- that's one of the things I miss most about Rochester. <em>sigh</em> glad you had a good time.</p>
