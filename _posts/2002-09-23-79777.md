Yay!! I got to see fuzzybunny about an hour ago. It was nice to see her even if the visit was just long enough to say hello and give her a birthday card. Perhaps she'll stay in town a little longer today and I can see her after class...not likely tho, she probably has to work and she lives 5 hours or so away...just in town to fill out some paperwork. Oh well, five minutes is better than missing her completely I guess. Oh, and I think she missed my truck because she got one of her own. Xterras are truly taking over the world.
