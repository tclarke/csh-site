    * **TV Program you watched?** South Park  



    * **Movie you saw at the theater?** Saving Christmas  



  * **Your thoughts on**
    * **Abortion?** Legalize it. I don't think it a great idea in an abstract sense but hey, it's not really my choice. Unless it can be shown that it's definately murder, then keep the option around.  



    * **Teenage smoking?** Stupid, tho I did it on occastion.  



    * **Spice Girls? **They kept stupid people from listening to my music and ruining it so I guess they has a purpose.** **
    * **Downloading music illegally?** Depends....I've done it and if it's done for the right reasons such as reasonable use (live concert recodings, etc.) or as a protest, go for it. If you're just a cheap bastard, then fuck you. I'm less for the protest bit now as there are some very reasonable pay to play services so it seems to be working. I think in general, it's a good thing tho as it's turned me onto some groups I never would have lisened to before.
