Well, they didn't accept our bid on that house. We are looking at another. It needs some work but we'll be able to finance the work. Even if there's $30k worth of repairs, it will still be less expensive then the first house!  



Tomorrow I'm competing at the TAMA invitational so wish me luck!  



In other news, Cleo had to go the the vet yesterday. She scratched her right cornea. I have to put antibiotic goop in her eye three times a day for a while. It's not too bad and she doesn't really mind it but she is upset at having to stay in the house for a few days.  



I'm still at work, about to head home.
