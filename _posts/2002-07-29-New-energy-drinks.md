Vitality Bull Energy Drink -- Tasty sweet-tartish thing that's not too overpowering in the taste department. It provides a decent buzz that's fairly soft so it is a nice everyday drink. It's a steal at $0.80 fir 240ml (about 8.5 oz)  



Korean ginsing drink with honey -- they little 4 oz bottles pack a puch. $0.90 of Pure Energy. These are water, honey, and a hunk of ginsing root floating in it. Tastes like slightly sweetened water with a slight earthy note...definately a unique flavor in the energy drink market. One of these can get me through twelve hours of gaming after a day of chores.  



Both of these are available at the Hikari Food Market on Mt. Hope (near Country Sweet and Thai Taste)
