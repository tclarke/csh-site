While thinking about my dream I realized I don't really remember high school anymore. I remember specific events and certain feelings and some details but not the day to day stuff. I don't remember how classes were laid out during the year (I think we had some sort of quarter system where gym class shifted activities, etc.). I don't remember the flow of a typical day. I guess it's been almost 10 years since high school. This is wierd.

<p>Yeah, there are many periods of time which I have completely forgotten about.  High school is definitely one of them.  I remember some specific things that happened while I was in high school, but overall I really don't have many memories.  Same goes for my time at RIT.  Since it was more recent, I still have some clue of what went on there, but it is also becoming one giant blur to me.</p>
