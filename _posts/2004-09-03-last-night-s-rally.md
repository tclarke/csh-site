Jenn and I volunteered at the Kerry-Edwards rally in Springfield last night. It was interesting. We worked media logistics (basically formed a chute to herd media to the proper places and kept everyone else out of the media area). We got to be in the media/vip area for the rally so we could see the stage really well. I went to the restroom just before they came out and couldn't get back to Jenn and the rest of the volunteers as the media chute crossed in front of the door they were coming out of so I waited patiently. I was rewarded as I was standing a couple of feet from the walkway when Kerry and Edwards walked out. I could have shaken their hands and all but they hustled out to ride the crowd's enthusiasm to the stage. The highlight of course was when Kerry announced that the Sox pulled to 2.5 games from the Yankees...is was wicked awesome. I'm tired now....leaving for Rochester in 5 hours.
