Had the final demonstration for the second part of my OS2 project today. Things went relatively well. Our problems were explained and understood, our demo work well, and we weren't the team who had the least done (not by far). One team didn't really have anything working and the other team was pretty much on par with us. Couple of days of rest now (sort of....Optics homework needs to be finished) then back to the grindstone. Next topic: Virtual Memory.
