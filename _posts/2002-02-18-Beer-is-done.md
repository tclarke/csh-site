Last night, klutzywaitress, riffraff and I went to Jeff and ravenstar's place last night for Adult Swin. We brought beer: Hennepin and Rare Vos from [Ommegang brewery](http://www.ommegang.com) and a great Belgian wheat beer. They were all great.  



Today I had my Beers of the world final. I nailed three out of eight beers and came close to identifying two or three more. Should be enough for an A.  



Now I'm in the library. I need to proofread my DAI slides and work on SE. Later, ravenstar and maybe riffraff are gonna join klutzywaitres and I at our last yoga class for the quarter.
