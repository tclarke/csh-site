It's been a week since I've posted and a busy week at that. I ran a lot of  
errands that I've been meaning to get to and I amused myself a little with  
books and movies and computers.



Yesterday, I rotated the tires on my truck and helped riffraf  
install new speakers in his car. Today, I ate crepes and worked on some oboe  
reeds. Gonna do some laundry later and eat chicken makani (sp?) for dinner.



I now have lots of Apple II computers (thanks to jerronimo) so  
I believe the 8-bit programming contest I was going to do last year will take  
place now. Rules to follow.



Also, I'm looking for 72-pin SIMMs and old DIMMs (5volt) so if anybody has  
some they would like to part with, please let me know.
