I just found some old pictures from my CSH years. I'll put them up behind the  
The first couple show me beating some random computer components. These are from Gibson hall (the few months CSH was there).

<p>It's christmas (1999 I think) at the Renaissance Grill. I'm not sure if I have those photo hunt pics anymore but I know that the negatives are in the house history cabinet on floor. I did scan them all so they are probably online somewhere. I'll see what I can do to dig them up.</p>
