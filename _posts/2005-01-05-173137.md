For those who have not seen it yet, there is [this](http://gigaom.com/2005/01/04/six-apart-to-buy-live-journal/).   



Update: there is a /. story [here](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/05/1537257&tid=95&tid=98) stating that there is no comment from either party involved thus this may be a rumor.

<p>Yeah, I was thinking that too b/c after I read the article I checked news on lj, and didn't see any mention of anything like this...</p>

</ul></div></div>
