Last night we decided to go paint the town red....Jenn and Amber arranged a trip to a local drag club and dragged Kari along. The club was pretty big, nicely decorated, and overall looked pretty good. There weren't many people there and the shows (if there were any that night) hadn't started yet. About 10:30 we decided to ditch that club (no cover, so we had nothing to lose) and go to the new Revolution location. We searched for Pearl for a little then found it and headed in. It was kind of slow there too so the girls had some drinks and I danced. Someone who used to be in my kung fu class works there as a bartender. I hadn't seen her in about 9 months so we caught up a little...not too much time to chat as she had to work. As the night progressed, the girls loosened up enough to dance. Just before we left they played some 90s club songs (starting with some Siouxsie per my request...YAY!) Much fun was had...we went to Waffle House then headed home. I went into work a little late today but that's ok because I worked more than 8 hours yesterday.
