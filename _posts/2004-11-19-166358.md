<p>if the thing that happened in florida in 2000 was like a man being beaten to death with a baseball bat in broad daylight in front of thousands of people, then....<br>

what happened throughout the bible belt and in ohio this election is like an assasination with a high powered rifle and a spotless, albeit false, alibi. <br>
