Ok, please take the poll before looking at the results or opening the cut.



I was getting some gas this morning and intended to get $15 worth. I overshot a little and instead of sticking with $15.08 I bumped it to $15.10. I was paying with a credit card and it struck me as strange that I would do this. Then I wondered if it was because my parents always use cash and before debit cards where widely accepted at gas stations I typically used cash as well. I'm wondering if this is a widespread phenomenon and if age has anything to do with it. That is, are people who grew up at the cusp of the electronic communication revolution more likely to display this behavior than people who are just starting to drive?  



I'm interested in getting as large a sampling as possible for this poll so please tell your LJ friends to come on over and vote.

<p>I remember at one time, gas stations would charge a few extra cents per gallon if you used a credit card.  Eventually, they started advertising "credit, same as cash" or something.  But I bet this is another reason why more people (such as our parents) used cash back then?</p>

<p>My wife when she used to pay cash, would try to get rid of all her pennies, and<br>
choose to pump something like 10.09.<br>
<br>
I use a special code dollar amount to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.<br>
(like any uber geek would)  So I top off, but not to a whole dollar amount on purpose.<br>
<br>
As the credit transaction cost has dropped, and the gas stations realize that if they <br>
encourage credit transactions. they will be less likely to be robbed (or loose less<br>
to a robbery) they have embraced credit transactions.</p>

<p>I have free credit card use with my bank (no fees except on debit) so it's cheeper if I don't have to go inside (and buy candy) for me to pay at the pump.  This is an interesting question.  I wonder if walking less (by paying at the pump) will soon be linked to increased obesity in the US or if paying at the pump without the temptaiton of buying junk food will be celebrated as a healthy america cause?</p>
