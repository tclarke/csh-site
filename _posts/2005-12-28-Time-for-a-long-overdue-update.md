Last week was a little hectic...trying to fit a weeks worth of work into three days. The weekend was good and Christmas was very good. Jenn was very happy with her new laptop. I got a new jacket, a hand weaved wool scarf, some new shirts, a new tie, and a few other things. I also got a nice whiskey decanter and tumblers from Galway Crystal but the decanter was shattered during shipping. I need to email them a picture of the damage and they will replace it.  



Christmas dinner was steak this year. Thick cut tenderloin cooked medium rare with fresh steamed broccolli and mashed potates. There was fruit and cream for desert. The wine was a cab-merlot blend.  



Monday was quite relaxing. I had the day off but jenn worked in the morning. We mostly hung out and watched some movies.  



Yesterday it was back to work for me but it was a slow day. I worked on a toy project of mine incorporating some MISI algorithms into Comet. I'm hoping to get approval to send a copy of Comet over to RIT. Shouldn't be too much of a problem but we will need gov't approval for it.  



This morning I decided to use a couple more hours of vacation and go in late. Jenn and I made skrumptious scones! I'm now sitting here putting off more work. After this post, I'll get back to it.
