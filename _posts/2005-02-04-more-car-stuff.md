So I just heard back from Nissan. The dangley thing, as I suspected, is the shield that's over the muffler. It's more of a salt/scumm shield then armor as it is very thin so it served it's purpose well. It's probably not worth replacing tho and the Nissan guy agreed (actually he said he didn't order the part cause there's little reason to replace it right now). The recall work is done. The new spring has been ordered and will cost about $135. With labor I'm estimating about $200 which isn't too bad. It will be a few days until the part is in.
