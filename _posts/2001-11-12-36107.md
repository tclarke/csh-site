I was just reminded of a pet peeve of mine. Why do people capitalize internet? The internet has become a medium for communications. It is not a product. It's silly to capitalize Telephone, why should we treat internet any differently?

<p>it's from the early days of arpanet when it was first turning into the Internet... they defined capital-I Internet as being the global internet, or the network of internets.  Lower-case-i internet refers to "an internet", or a network of networks.</p>
