Jenn, Brent and I saw Tropic Thunder on thursday. It rocked. That's all I say for now except, go see it.  



Friday, Jenn and I drove to Indy. I met up with a bunch of friends for gencon. I didn't go to a lot of events this year, just hung out in the exhibit hall and board game room most of the time. The new BSG boardgame is awesome. It was pre-release sales only and they were sold out when I got there but I definitely want a copy when it's officially released in a couple of months. There wasn't much else going on as far as new releases, WOW minis was big and there were some smaller releases. I only bought one thing for myself, Fishing for Terrorists...it's basically go fish with action cards. It's a fun, fast play game.  



I played in one LARP this year. Since I only had one night to play, I skipped the WoD LARP and played a freeform Lovecraft themed LARP. It was a great LARP. Lots of good role players, freeform (i.e. no resolution system, role play only) and run by someone with lots of freeform experience.  



I decided to run the segway challenge this year because I had some extra generic tickets. Segways are interesting beasts...I'd would have liked to spend more time on it.  



It was a good weekend and I was glad I decided to go. Rob is awesome for putting us up in his house and it was good to see Brian...still have to make it out to Rochester sometime and see the baby. Anyway, I'm definitely planning on going next year and I think I'll run an event or two if anybody wants to help out. I've got a few ideas but am always open.
