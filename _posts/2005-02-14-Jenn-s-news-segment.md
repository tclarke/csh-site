You may remember that Jenn was on the news a few months ago during the election. I finally got around to digitizing it and getting it on the net. [It can be downloaded here.](http://www.csh.rit.edu/%7Eretrev/livejournal/2005-02-14/Jenn_News_Segment_Xenia_2004.avi.torrent)   
Downloading requires [bittorrent](http://bittorrent.com/) as this will save my bandwidth. I'll keep it up for a couple of days, if you want to grab it and there are no seeders, let me know and I'll put it back up. The file is encoded in [Xvid](http://www.xvid.org/). Grab that codec and MediaPlayer on windows shouild work. If you have another OS and have trouble let me know.
