I got some new icons.  



And I dug this out of my image archive.  
A few years ago I designed this t-shirt. Given the current Sun-Linux tension, maybe it's time to make some more. Anybody want one?

<p>I only voted for 'nothing' because honestly the best way to end a conversation is to have no clue what you're talking about. And that'd be me, if I were wearing that t-shirt.<br>
