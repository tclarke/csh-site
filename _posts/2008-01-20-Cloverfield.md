So, we saw it today. Not bad...not great. Definately see it in the theatre...the effects are one of the stronger points for the film. If you don't dig shaky "home video" camera work, don't see it. It's your classic monster flick but from the innocent bystander's point of view and without the happy ending (here's a hint..the monster doesn't exactly lose). Had the gritty, artsy vibe of blare witch but more action...pretty much non-stop after the first 15 minutes or so. The monster was a little disappointing (I was hoping for the serious, artsy, indy movie thing...then...blammo! Dude in a latex dinosaur costume)  



Long story short....not for those who get dissy easily and see it in the theatre, but not at full price.



EDIT: Oh...there's a teaser for Star Trek...*drool*....and Hellboy II directed by Guillermo del Toro....I want them both sooooo bad.
