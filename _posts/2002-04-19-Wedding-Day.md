I'm up bright and early (been up for a couple of hours now) for the [wedding](http://www.csh.rit.edu/~jnew/wedding). klutzywaitress is making scone for the wedding party (of which I'm a part...mmm scones). I just got out of the shower and I'm avoiding my tux since I'll be in it all day. I'm making some more clotted cream for the scones and some tea (thanks to fishslayer). Still gotta write down my best-man toast. I known I'm a slacker...I've known what I wanted to say for a while, just having trouble putting it all to words. Anywho, I'll update after the festivitees.
