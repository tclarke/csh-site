Ugh....the past couple of weeks have sucked. I've been super busy at work and I'v been kinda sick. I keep dehydrating and getting headaches...probably a cold or just dry air.  



I had to work yseterday and all morning cause DCE is a POS. Maybe I'll take monday off.  



[Brian](http://www.livejournal.com/users/fishslayer) and [Rachel](http://www.livejournal.com/users/fuzzybunny) came over yesterday for St. Patrick's day. Dinner was good even if I did have to work through much of it. Played cards after and had a pretty relaxing rest-of-the-evening.  



I'm going to search for dinner. I have a headache again so I'll probably get take-out instead of cooking.
