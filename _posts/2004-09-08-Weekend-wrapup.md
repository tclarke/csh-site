Friday: I left work early (about 2)Â  and registered my car. I had been waiting for a copy of my release of financial obligation letter from 1st priority so I could transfer my title to Ohio w/o the lien.This took about an hour. Laundry was washed, packing was completed, and we hit the road somewhere around 5. Arrived in Rochester at nearly 2 and gabbed with Brian for a while before collapsing on the couch.  



Saturday: Up at 9:30 or so, 10:30 breakfast at Jim's with Jenn, Brian, Adam, Mimi, and Jason. Afterwards, Jenn, Mimi, and Adam took Jason shopping for some appropriate pimpin clothes. Brian and I made out way to RIT to see if any kung fu people were around and to look at the new field house. We spent some time chatting over at CSH and finished the afternoon with coffee and a bagel at Bruegers. After meeting up with Jenn and Jason we picked up Kim and Robyn for some dinner at the Toad. Gillian, et al were just leaving so I got to see them briefly. Steak and kidney pie and a nice hoppy ale make for an excellant late summer meal. Next, it was off to Vertex with Mimi and Adam for a night of dancing and socializing....had to leave earlier than I would have liked as everyone was getting a little tired but a good time was had. More beer, pizza, and crazy pets awaited us at Mimi's house until we finally returned to Brians for sleep at around 2.  



Sunday: The was a day of sleeping in. Brunch at the Highland Park Diner provided energy which we used to prepare for the wedding. The ceremony was short and quite nice. I was pleasantly surprised that Bill Stratton officiated. There was food and some dancing, but mostly wedding type songs so I socialized. Afterwards, there was a old school CSH party in one of the hotel rooms complete with drunken brides maids and [The Captain](http://captainmorgan.com). Jenn, Brian, and I left a bit early as we were quite tired from the weekend's events.  



Monday: Another lazy morning saw Jenn off to spend some time with Katie. Brian and I visited Tim and the kids for a while. We met Jenn and Katie back at Brian's for some lunch. Returning Katie to Webster and some equipment to RIT ended our stay in Rochester. On the way back to Dayton we drove through Cleveland instead of around it so Jenn could see the city a little bit. We got into town around 1:30 and immediately crashed.  



The future: Two long days at work are in progress. There's little to do this week as we are finishing up for a major release and there are no more major bugs but we aren't quite ready to start working on the next iteration. Tomorrow at 10:35am Jenn and I board a plane headed for Boston. An afternoon and early dinner await us at Legal Seafood in the Pru then we try and avoid the commuter train crowds bound for the Patt's first game of the season. Four days and another wedding await us in RI and another plane trip out of Boston on tuesday when we return home to Dayton. I will be somewhat available via email and lj during the remainder of my vacation, or as always, you can get our cells.
