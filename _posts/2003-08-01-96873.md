I did something stupid today. I was at work, ringing out the mop...pushing down on the ringer handle. The handle poped out of the slot on the bucket and I fell, feet flying out in front. I hit my head on the wall, landed on the side of the kettle. Next, the malt laddle fell on my head making a tremendous clang. Finally, my left arm landed in the mop water submerging itself halfway up my bicep. Ugh....on top of a bad day yesterday, little sleep last night, the oven breaking during the morning rush....Although, this did lighten everyone's spirits a little (after they checked to see if I was hurt of course). Maybe I should change careers and become a jester.
