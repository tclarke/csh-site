I'll post more updates later. For now, I wanna share a link. If you've ever played Axis &amp; Allies (and even if you havn't), check out [triplea](http://triplea.sourceforge.net). It lets you play classic AA and custom maps and scenarios. If anybody wants to get a game going (real-time or play be email) let me know.
