Jenn just asked if I needed coffee or anything to drive her to the airport. As I was popping outta bed and getting dressed all wide eyed and bushy tailed I realized that if nothing else, Brueggers taight me how to be up and driving at 4am. I'll be good for about 2.5 or 3 hours then I'll crash for about 1/2 hour then good again until around noon. I thought about giving Jeff a ring to say good morning but I'm not sure if he's working this morning and I can't remember to phone number at Brueggers. Oh well...off to take Jenn.

<p>Nothing will ever teach me to be wide awake at 4am.  When we went on our honeymoon we had to be picked up at 4:30am for the flight to Chicago (on to Hawaii from there).  I remember nothing until about 8am (7am in Chicago).</p>

<p>I was so programmed that during the drive to work I drove exactly the speed limit regardless of how awake I was...I might not even look at the speedometer until I was almost there. Great for avoiding all the cops out at that time.</p>
