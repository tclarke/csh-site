I've been somewhat non-existant online lately. I'd like to say I've been to busy to update but that's not really true, I just havn't felt like it. Anyway, work is work; not much going on here. I'm competing in the TAMA invitational next saturday (April 29). If anyone wants to come watch some kung fu (and other arts), it's at Bellbrook Jr. High at noon. It's $5 to get in. If you'd like more information, let me know. If you are planning on going, also let me know, just because I'd like to know. :)  



The big news of the last couple of weeks. Jenn and I are shopping around for a house. We get the details on our mortgage today sometime. The broked said we'd be approved for something...he's just waiting to hear about an FHA loan which would give us a lower interest rate and less of a down payment. Jenn has posted a couple of listings we are interested in looking at to her journal. We're talking to a realtor today. Soon we'll be looking at a bunch of stuff. Anyone have any advice? Locations? Know any nice houses for sale? We are looking at an upper range of about 100k. Looking mostly north and east of Dayton (Riverside, northern Kettering, etc.) so we can stay close to work, but there are a couple of nice looking places in the Golden Triangle. Anyone know much about that neighborhood? It's in north west Dayton but looks like it's north of the ghetto.  



Finally..Kari, glad to hear your mom isn't as serious as feared. Lunakitty, hope to pup comes out ok as well.
