Well...I think I got my beer going. It started fermenting shortly after the infection was noticed. (I guess it is a zombie) I racked it to another fermenter, leaving the top part with the infection and hopefully there won't be any off flavors.  



Saturday, I went to tai chi and kung fu. Had a pretty good workout then headed back home. Jenn and I went to a party later that night and had a pretty good time. Not much more to report on saturday.  



Sunday was yard work day. We cleaned up the yard a bit. Jenn tore out much of the shade garden near the A/C and planted some new ivy and a jacob's ladder. I patched a hole in the driveway and a few cracks in the outdoor fireplace (a.k.a. the former bbq) I put a new layer of sand down in the fireplace to provide a stable, vegetation free bed for wood. It now incorporates an official RIT brick. I put some mulch down around one of our trees and along side the driveway. I also cleaned up the trash can area and put up a new bird feeder. We bought a sturdy metal arbor for the front yard. Regular $90. We paid $16. Woo! Pictures of the yard available.
