I went to work again today. There were 2 other ppl helping so we got a lot done. Had bagels. Came home. In the car, I had a preminition that klutzywaitress went to the hospital an it freaked me out a little. I got home and the alarm was off and she wasn't there...getting a little more upset. Then I realized the power was off and I had a minor nervous breakdown. After I gathered myself together, I called fishslayer and he said she had gone out to lunch with a friend who was in town and ended up at skyes' house. I called her there and chatted briefly. I'm now in java wally's trying to occupy myself. Ugh...not a good day.
