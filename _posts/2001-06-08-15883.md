I'm in RI for the weekend. [Brian](http://www.livejournal.com/users/fishslayer) is here to. [Rachel](http://www.livejournal.com/users/fuzzybunny) had a lab so she is in Rochester. Simple sentences are neat. My brother graduated high school tonight. He is returning with us to Rochester. I will sleep now.
