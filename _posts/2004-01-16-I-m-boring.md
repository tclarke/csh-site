We didn't play dnd tonight and nobody came to visit me so I spent the night playing with my new DVD+-RW drive. No blank media so I didn't test burning yet but it plays dvd's like a charm. I also downloaded the pilot for Earth2 (both episodes) and watched the first episode. I think I'll grab as many episodes of the shows I've latched onto over the years as I can (even if they are mostly divx) and make some tv boxed sets. Maybe put some extras (like cast bios) and even commentary on some if I get adventurous. That way I'll them for my collection and maybe someone else out there might want them too.  



Currently I want:  
Earth2  
Enterprise (although I'm sure this will have an official DVD release one of these days)  
DS9

<p>I have all of DS9 on DVD.  Earth2 was pretty cool.  They took too long getting to the point of the show though.  What I really want is Seaquest DSV on DVD.</p>
