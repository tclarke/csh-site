Another busy weekend working. I missed the Crystal Method on Saturday which I'm a slight bit upset about but I'll survive. :)   I missed another dig too...it's been a while. Maybe the next one...if not, there will be something held in the new house. I might go see X3 today. That's about it. I'm so boring these days.
