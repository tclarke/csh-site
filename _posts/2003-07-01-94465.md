Ok, I'm making a new t-shirt (thanks to Rachel for the glorious idea). It'll be your typically white on black goth-topic tee and it'll say "I hate you because that's what goth's do"  



BTW, Vertex on thursday anyone? (I prefer saturday but I have friday off work and 4am work on sat and sun so that's the way the cookie crumbles)
