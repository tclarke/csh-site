Back from RI again. klutzywaitress and fishslayer went with me to RI. We had a little party for mine and my brother's birthdays on friday.  



Saturday, we had breakfast, Jenn and I went to see my cousin's new house and went canoing on the Pawcatuck river for a couple of hours. His house is great and we had much fun.  



Next, it was off to Jenn's sister's house to see her new baby. What a cutie! Many hours were spent there, then home to bed.  



About 3am, we were awoken by the fierce storm outside. Shortly after, lightning struck about a block from us knocking out electricity and phone. Power was back on by 9:30 when we got up but the phone is still down. Ask fishslayer about the lightning, he happened to be looking out the window when it struck and saw it.  



Sunday we slept in a little, offloaded the canoe, harassed the phone company and had scones and tea at [Tealuxe](http://www.tealuxe.com) in Providence. I got an organic ceylon (50g packet) for 25% off! Wh00t!  



We packed the car and headed home to arrive a short time ago.  



Next time, we are hoping to go on Seth's (my cousin) new 34' sailboaot to Block island for a weekend.  



That is all...
