Brian's wedding was this weekend..I'll not go into many details as others have done so already. However, there is one story which bears repeating. About 11:50 saturday, Tim, Brian and I were driving to the church. Brian was worried he was gonna be late so he was speeding. Tim saw the cop turn his wheels from 100 yards so we new we were busted. Before the officer could say anything, Brian blurts out "I'm going to be late for my wedding." The officer checks brian's license, reg, etc. Asks when the wedding is ("1 o'clock but we have to be there at 12:15"). "Are you the best man?" etc. He then says, "You're gonna have a busy day as it is so let's be honest here. How fast were you driving?" Brian says about 80. The office responds with, "well, you must have slowed down because you were only going 73 over that hill. I hope your marriage goes as well as this stop." And he walks away.
