I was a good boy and did my tax return last night (federal and state..still have to do both city returns). I used TaxCut's web app this year...it's cheaper than their download/CD app and works just as well. (it's AJAXy and pretty snappy) Only cost $40 to fill out and e-file both.  



I also re-synched my music at work and home so I've been listening to some "new" stuff all day. I grabbed a few new albums.  



* Beethoven Symphony No.9 performed by the Vienna Philharmonic  
* The Mirror Conspiracy - Thievery Corporation  
* Some ragas by Ali Akbar Khan  
* Absolutego by boris  
* Dave Brubeck - Live Take Five!  



I don't feel like doing write ups on any of these right now. If you got questions on any of them, comment and I'll talk about them.
