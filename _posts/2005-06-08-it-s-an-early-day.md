I came in a bit earlier than normal today so I can duck out early when Mimi stops by for a bit. I've been here 45 minutes already and I'm still running on auto-pilot. It's going to be a pretty boring day too as it's the last day before our next rollup and I'm through my task list. I'll pick up something I've got on a back burner and be a little pre-active but I'm not really into working on any of those tasks today. Feel free to IM me if you want to amuse me this morning.
