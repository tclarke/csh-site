Well, we did it...the Xterra is gone and I now own a Mercedes-Benz C230 Kompressor coupe. I'm going to miss the truck but the new car is fantastic. It's fun to drive, gets decent mileage (high 20's/low 30's), it's fairly roomy for a coupe, and it's duper reliable. It's jam pack with extras and toys....it will automagically check the engine oil level at the push of a button. I'm going to enjoy this awesome weather...I'll make a more detailed post a little later...for now, here are some pictures...last day for the Xterra (or Mister X as it came to be known) and first day for the C230K. (no name yet)
