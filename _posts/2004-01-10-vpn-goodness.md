<p>What client/server software are you using?</p>

<p>IPsec and IKE w/ preshared keys (esp mode). Brian is using a linksys w/ vpn support, phyber is using an IOS cisco, and I'm running OpenBSD.</p>

<p>Cool.  My linksys could probably do that.<br>

For work, we use the Contivity VPN client.  Their backend doesn't like to make nice with non-proprietary setups (unless something has changed).<br>
