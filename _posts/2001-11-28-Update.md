Went from Cape Cod to Quincy last night and hopped the T to [Sara's](http://www.livejournal.com/users/sberg) apartment. Proceeded to IHOP (YUCK!!) for coffee, etc. Most of the Boston crew was there so that was nice (sorry Eliza, I forgot to say hi, maybe next time I'm in Boston). Manny was nice enough to drive us back to Quincy since the last T had left...if I had known there would be a nice big school parking lot across from Sara's I would have driven direct to Cambridge intead of going to Quincy. Oh well.. Got back to Lincoln at about 2:30 and crashed. Missed breafast with mom cause I was tired but at least I saw her briefly before work. Waiting for [Jenn](http://www.livejournal.com/users/klutzywaitress) to get out of the shower so I can get ready and head off to Rochester. See everyone later tonight.  



BTW:  



![Gimli](http://www.lordoftherings.net/images/ca_jrhys.jpg)| 



**Gimli Gloin's son**



If I were a character in [_The Lord of the Rings_](http://lordoftherings.net/), I would be Gimli, Dwarf, handy with an axe when orcs are about.



In the movie, I am played by [John Rhys-Davies](http://www.lordoftherings.net/film/cast/ca_jrhys.html).



Who would _you_ be?
