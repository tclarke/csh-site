I've been taking dicloxacillin for a skin infection I had on my leg. I had two pills left (taking 4 a day for a week and a half). Woke up this morning and my hand itched. I have a rash head to toe so I went to the student death center. Seems I'm suddenly allergic to penicillin. Harumph, I itch a lot.
