Well, it's nearly time for kung fu rank testing again. I don't think I'll be testing this year as I'm short on review time and I havn't been for months (until about 3 weeks ago). I'm afraid I'll have a repeat of last year...not passing because I had no time to study and only enough time to practice maybe 2 times per week.  



On another note, I applied to about two dozen jobs today including a plethora at LLNL. Maybe something will come out of it.
