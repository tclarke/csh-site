<p>I LOVE the bold colors!  They look awesome!<br>
<br>
And I ADORE your house!  I love houses with character (and I am NOT one of those people who says that to mean anythig negative) - I live in a cookie-cutter subdivision house - and it's SO BORING.  Your place is SO COOL!<br>
<br>
I also love the living room windows!</p>

<p>Thanks! We like it too...I grew up in a very old New England colonial so I'm used to character...older houses can be a pain (our wiring is old and we have plaster walls) but I think it's worth it.<br>
<br>
The colors are Jenn's choice with some input from my mom. My mom does this sort of thing professionally so she's got a lot of experience choosing complementary colors and treatments. That's why she came out to help with some of the painting. Some of the paints actually came from the Lowes and Home Depot oops bin ($5 paint is hard to pass up) so she has been collecting colors she's liked. We found the ones that work well and bought some complementary colors for the treatments.<br>
<br>
We painted the bathroom a couple of months ago (before the sink was in) and this week did the dining room, part of the bedroom (still need to paint the ceiling and trim there) and the two alcoves so there's still quite a bit to go. It's nice having at least one room that's finished.<br>
<br>
Anywho....back to work for me....feel free to come out to Ohio and see it in person! :-)</p>

<p>That looks amazing! How did you get the effect in the front alcove? I love it!</p>

<p>We dabbed/sponged on a glaze of metallic acrylic craft paint in gold, copper and bronze, using a caramel base coat of normal latex wall paint. Thank you! :)</p>

<p>That's so cool! You would get along with mostlie_sunnie's mom great! She's always doing stuff like that. :)<br>
<br>
I used to be an interior design major, and I miss it so much.</p>

<p>Are you <i>serious</i>???<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>I</i> was taking interior design classes until just last month!<br>
<br>
<br>
Why 'used to'? Why did you stop?<br>
<br></p>

<p>I ran out of money, and had to leave school for a while...which turned into 3 years, and when I went back, the school I went to didn't offer it, so I opted for graphic design thinking that most of the basic classes would be similar. And they were...design, colors, drawing, art history, blah blah.<br>
<br>
Now I have a degree, and a job, and I think about going back to it, but I really love where I am, and I want to pay down my student loans first.<br>
<br>
Did you finish last month? Or change majors?</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>retrev: </h3>

<p>She's thinking about a shift in careers...she's already got a bachelors in communication and was going back to school for interior design...she decided that the creative fields she's interested in are either too cut throat (most of the advertising world) or too difficult to break into...she's thinking about a medical career now (nursing or some sort of lab tech) but needs to wait a bit to get into either program.</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>xoraclex: </h3>

<p>I know what you are saying about the competition. I decided halfway through my second year for graphic design that I probably didn't want anything to do with the competition, and the idea of selling things I don't believe in, or that people don't really need. The compromise I made with myself, since I was already so far along (and actually decently talented) is that I will only work for non-profits. With the exception of one free-lance project that I did for a small local business that went terribly awry (she took my designs and had someone finish them and refused to pay me), I've worked entirely for non-profit. <br>
<br>
Now I'm in a position that is art related, utilizes my graphic design skills, but is non-profit. Plus I'm helping homeschool on the side. I can't say that my train jumping the track wasn't for the better.<br>
<br>
I really do miss interior design though. I loved doing it so much!<br>
<br>
My mom was trying to get me to go into a medical field, just for the money, but I'm so squeamish that no amount of money could convince me.<br>
<br>
For info purposes, my mother got a two year degree in respiratory therapy, it is super high demand. You can play it like long distance companies, keep switching hospitals for the sign on bonuses...and it pays really well. She originally went to school for lab tech, and then switched after her first year.</p>

<p>Stopped going... due to some disorganization. I kept putting off registering for the next class in the sequence because I wasn't sure what my work schedule would be like (or if I would even have a job). So I missed the window. Now I gotta figure out how I'm going to get down there to do my change of resident/tuition fee paperwork for when I eventually start taking classes again.</p>

<p>Eeep! Which school? Maybe Penny could help. Unless you are looking into Clark State, I don't have much info or the hook-up.</p>
