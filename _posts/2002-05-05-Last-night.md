I played DnD yesterday as I do every saturday. It was our worst session so far. It was great hanging out with everyone but the game was tedious and boring (very atypical) but I guess this is to expected. The big climax of the last 3 months is next week so we were just finishing our trip to the place where the devils are going to try and kill us. Oh well, can't be great everyweek and the DM promises to have an extra special game planned for next week...too bad I won't be here. :(  



After gaming, I went to Vertex with riffraff, Gail, and her friend Corey. klutzywaitress was supposed to go after work at 11:00 but called me saying she had to stay until midnight. After the typical, "I'll wait for you if you want", "no, go with everyone else and I'll meet you" discourse, I went with the others. It wasn't a particularly good night. The typical array of standard Vertex songs was there but nothing else special. I did run into gemineyemimi which was great. Gail had a terrible time and I should have just told her to go home and that I would get rides for Kim and Corey.  



Jenn didn't get home until nearly 1:00 and then had to deal with the alarm company becuase she set off the burglar alarm and could find her cancel code. She finially arrived at the club at about 2:00 and we decided to just go to Jay's so she wouldn't have to pay cover for 45 minutes of club time. Corey wen home with another friend and the rest of us had some food.  



That pretty much sums up the night. wjdresden is DJing next thursday so maybe we'll go then and hope things aren't as hectic.
