**1\. Do you trust your instincts?** Most of the time.  



**2\. Get up and go or plan, plan, plan?** I usually plan but I keep it open enough for changes along the way.  



**3 Do you ask for directions when you are lost or do you keep on going?** It depends. If I have no clue where to go or if time is of the essence I'll ask for directions. If I'm sorta lost, I can usually get back on track pretty quickly.  



**4, Right now: do you know which way is east?** Smell for avocados and go the other way. Actaully, I do have a very good sense of directions. (see part 2 of question 3)  



**5\. If a tree falls in the woods, and no one hears it -- did it make a noise?** It made the physical disturbance of the air required to make a noise but since all sensory manifestations are concrete only in the mind it didn't really make a noise. Of course, if two people are there it made two noises.
