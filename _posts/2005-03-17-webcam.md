<p>Nobody is home so it would be quite boring...I'll turn it on later. It's actually ww.com (which is now also camarades). ww.com is free (mostly). you can get a pay account and view "restricted" cams. their adult policy is voluntary...cams with questionable content are asked to set them to restricted so that only paying members can view them. I havn't set this flag so it's all free. If you know a better hosting place, let me know (one w/ a freebsd cap package is prefered...I'd like to move the cam to my server).<br>

One of the local k-marts is closing so I got it there. It's normally a $20 cam that was 20% off. It's a Labtec which is really a Logitec Quickcam (2 I think) rebranded. It's USB, manual focus, comes with a stand. Not too bad quality tho I'm thinking of moding it to either include a visible light source or make it a NIR camera w/ IR light source.</p>
