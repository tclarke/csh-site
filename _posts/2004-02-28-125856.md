[This](http://www.livejournal.com/users/guaymar/36914.html) one is funny.



This one is less..  
![Scroll in your toga?](http://images.quizilla.com/F/francescadez/1063165786_slatintoga.jpg) Estne volumen in toga, an solum tibi libet me  
videre?  
"Is that a scroll in your toga, or are you  
just glad to see me?"  
You're smooth, okay, but you also need a  
girlfriend. Bad.
