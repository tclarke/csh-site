Well, GenCon was awesome. The guys all showed up on Tuesday and we grabbed as much sleep as possible. Wednesday, Brian and Don went to Indy early to go to the educators seminars on trade day. The rest of us slept in a little and just hung out for a bit. We arrived at the hotel in the early afternoon, unpacked, relaxed, and watched some Firefly. Dinner involved a trip to RAM. We didn't want to wait over an hour for a seat so Brian slipped someone $20 and we sat right down. :)  



Every morning except Sunday, someone had an 8am event so we were up by 6 every day. Our ending times ranged from 11pm to about 1am so little sleep was had. I played a D&amp;D; good vs. evil dungeon crawl which was fun despite a rules lawyer/dick who was playing as well. I also played a CoC d20 game which was fun. Three LARPs graced my schedule this year: the Camarilla Requiem game, a Vampire LARP run by the folks at Sick & Twisted Productions, and an awesome Firefly LARP. The whole crew played a LEGO Pirate Wars mini's (maxi's? they were big) battle on Sunday which was uber cool.  



I spent some time in the exhibit hall and managed not to spend too much. I got some freebies and I bought a couple of games including En Garde! from Slugfest games. Like Kung Fu Fighting but better. I also got Mark Sheppard's autograph and spent a few minutes chatting with him. He will be back in BSG next season! The people who ran the Firefly LARP asked him if he wanted to play the Badger NPC and we was considering it but the game ran while he was scheduled for signings. I also met (and got an autograph from) Hayden Panettiere. She plays the cheerleader on Heroes.  



Next year I'd like to GM a game or two. Maybe a Deliria tabletop or LARP. (anyone want to run this with me?) I also want to run a Paranoia LARP that runs the whole con (like Guardian 6). You'd pick up assignments from the computer when you had spare time. Everyone would get a badge flag with their security color and other assorted information. Many of the gaming halls would have security clearance colors and if an event you were in was higher clearance, you'd have to be creative to get in or not get caught. Also, any Guardian 6 player are spies and obviously commies and should be dealt with accordingly.
