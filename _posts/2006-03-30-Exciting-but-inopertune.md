So, my kung fu style's grandmaster will be at TAMA in a little over a week. There will be an induction of new deciples which happens occastionally when he is in town. I've been asked to be a disciple. A kung fu discipleship, for those who don't know, is a great honor. It shows that the master (and in this case, grandmaster) see a certain dedication and devotion to the art. No matter where I go or what I do, I'd always be a disciple of tien shan pai. The problem? Among the ritual surrounding an induction, there's a monitary donation made to the master and grandmaster. The amount varies from person to person and is meant to be a sacrifice to show how serious you are about being a disciple. There are no guidelines on the amount, but too little would be seen as insulting. Since everyone there is paying a fair amoung of tuition to attend the school that sets an unofficial, unspoken minimum. Probing some current diciples and we find someone gave about $1000 to master Taningco and an unknown amount to grandmaster. Although this is a large amount the general feeling is that donations are in the 100's of dollars. I'm not sure if I can come up with a respectible amount in time. If I can't, all is not lost. Grandmaster tries to come to Dayton at least once a year and I'd likely be invited in the future if I decline this time. If only I had another week or two it wouldn't be as much a problem.

<p>can you decline on the grounds of financial hardship, or can you do like what folks do down here, tithe to a church, its 10 percent of their income...like, you could give them ten percent of a months salary or something. <br>
<br>
thats really cool, though!</p>

<p>I can decline the discipleship for any reason, it's entirely voluntary. As for the donation, if I take the discipleship, that's not really voluntary. If I can't afford it, I can wait until next time and most likely they would offer again. The donation is a one time thing too, not like a tithe. It's a gift to say thank you, and show my seriousness.</p>

<p>oh...does the gift <em>have</em> to be monetary? <br>
<br>
could it be something else, like free major publicity for their school or something? <br>
<br>
i dont know how any of that works, but it sounds like a cultural thing, which is why i am so facinated and asking so many dumb questions...</p>

<p>There are a series of gifts, the money being the most noticable these days. For example, the money if given in a red envelope. A bag of gems is given. (These days, a small bag of costume jewelry type stones is usually used...glass or semi-precious) Most of these are more ritualistic these days, the money being the major "sacrifice" part. In addition to the gifts, there are also oaths taken, etc. Beyond all this, there's the additional responsibility to the school and the art. Disciples are role models to other students. They are expected to give help out with school events, show up at public events and help market the school, assist with running the school when necessay, and to ensure that the traditions and knowledge of the art are passed on.</p>
