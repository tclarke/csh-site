I didn't quite get enough sleep last night and when I got out of work, I walked to campus (from southtown). At the time, this was a rather invigorating and all around nice walk. I went to the cs labs to kill time and became rather lethargic due to the heat, lack of movement, and CS lab smell. I walked into the wrong class (the one next to my class) and didn't realize it till class started (it was another cs class and I figured that my prof was busy and had someone else lecturing for the day). I was too lazy to leave until the break after the first hour. I walked right by my class and went to the COS study center where I know sit trying to nap. Ugh.
